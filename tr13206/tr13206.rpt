This first loxP site is followed by a neomycin resistance gene under the control of the human beta-actin promoter, SV40 polyA, a second FRT site and a second loxP site.  A third loxP site is inserted downstream of the targeted exon(s) at position 60970201.  The critical exon(s) is/are thus flanked by loxP sites.  A "conditional ready" (floxed) allele can be created by flp recombinase expression in mice carrying this allele.  Subsequent cre expression results in a knockout mouse.  If cre expression occurs without flp expression, a reporter knockout mouse will be created.

Chchd4<tm2a(EUCOMM)Hmgu>	The L1L2_GT1_LF2A_LacZ_BetactP_neo cassette was inserted at position 91465742 of Chromosome 6 upstream of the critical exon(s) (Build GRCm38).  The cassette is composed of an FRT site followed by lacZ sequence and a loxP site.  This first loxP site is followed by a neomycin resistance gene under the control of the human beta-actin promoter, SV40 polyA, a second FRT site and a second loxP site.  A third loxP site is inserted downstream of the targeted exon(s) at position 91464150.  The critical exon(s) is/are thus flanked by loxP sites.  A "conditional ready" (floxed) allele can be created by flp recombinase expression in mice carrying this allele.  Subsequent cre expression results in a knockout mouse.  If cre expression occurs without flp expression, a reporter knockout mouse will be created.

First:
1. remove duplicate primary key indexes created in the index scripts (these are automatically created in the key scripts for the primary keys)
2. write trigger migration script for radar

Next; start manual mode, no more migrations for triggers, stored procedures and indexes (because manually removing primary key indexes in the index scripts AND leaving a stub script (empty) when the only current index is primary.
1. run migration
2. create backup of mgd sybase database used for migration
3. create backup of migrated postgres database
4. use DELETE CASCADE in key scripts to replace sybase triggers used for referential integrity only
5. edit/write triggers for radar and mgd
We need six scripts for each table, a drop script for insert, update, delete triggers and a create script insert, update, delete triggers
6. write scripts to test triggers agains postgres and sybase for comparison
7. write stored procedures for radar and mgd after triggers are done.

Misc:
1. discussion of user lower indexes
2. updating of sql conversion wiki - can you send me the link?

. tinyint		smallint

. change "varchar" to "text"

. "offset" variable is restricted
	MRK_Offset, MRK_Location_Cache
	must be changed to "mgdOffset" (or some other variable)

.  table names are created as lower-case even if the create statement 
   contains upper/lower case:

    create table ACC_Accession

   is created as "acc_accession".

   if I created the table using:

    create table "ACC_Accession"

   the table is greated with proper case, but
   I am unable to perform a query:

    select * from ACC_Accession
    ERROR:  relation "acc_accession" does not exist

.  migration from sybase (bcp) to postgres (copy)

   ) bcp: does not support a binary file dump

   ) bcp: has a "-t" option to set the column delimiter
	  has a "-r" option to set the line delimiter
	  our delims are "&=&" an "#=#" (mgidbutilities/bin/bcpout.csh)

     copy: has a column delimiter option, but it only allows
	   a single character...this is not very useful!
	   does not have a line delimiter option
	   the default for column delim is "\t"
	   the default for line delim is "\n"

   ) MGD "Note" tables (11) contain "\n" in the notes.
     Other MGD tables may also contain "\n" in their fields.
     We'll have to figure out a way to replace the "\n" in our fields
     with another value ("\r"?) in order to load this data into postgres

   ) sybase "datetime" vs. postgres "timestamp"

      vs.

      Feb  4 1998  5:00:54.313PM

      The millisecond field in sybase is ":" and in posgres is ".".

      Am using a perl script that Jeremy has to "sed" the 
      "datetime" fields to compatible format for "copy".

   ) copy: invokes triggers and contraints

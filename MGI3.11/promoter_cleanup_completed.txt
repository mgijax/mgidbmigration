MGI:2176167	Tg(Wap-cre)11738Mam	This transgene directs the expression of Cre recombinase under the control of a 2.6 kb (EcoRI-Asp718) mouse whey acidic protein (Wap) promoter fragment. The Wap promoter directed expression of Cre recombinase in the mammary glands of late pregnant and lactating female mice.  No expression was detected in mammary tissue of virgin mice.
MGI:2429539	Tg(Wap-Mmp3)5Sym	Modified rat matrix metalloproteinase 3 (Mmp3) sequence was adjoined to a 2.4 kb murine Wap promoter fragment. The Mmp3 sequence contained a proline to valine substitution mutation at codon 93, thereby conferring autoactivation. Immunocytochemical analysis identified abundant transgenic protein in mammary tissues in pregnant and lactating mice.
MGI:2429538	Tg(Wap-Mmp3)9Sym	Modified rat matrix metalloproteinase 3 (Mmp3) sequence was adjoined to a 2.4 kb murine Wap promoter fragment. The Mmp3 sequence contained a valine to glycine substitution mutation at codon 92, thereby conferring autoactivation. Immunocytochemical analysis identified abundant transgenic protein in mammary tissues in pregnant and lactating mice.
MGI:1890080	Tg(Wnt1)1Hev	Wnt1 is driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV).  The construct resembles alleles found in virus-induced tumors.
MGI:2386570	Tg(Wnt1-cre)11Rth	The Wnt1 promoter preceded the cre recombinase coding sequence which was followed downstream by the Wnt1 enhancer. The Wnt1 regulatory sequences initially direct expression in the midbrain. After neural tube closure, expression occurs in the dorsal and ventral midlines of the midbrain and caudal diencephalon, the midbrain-hindbrain junction and in the dorsal spinal cord.
MGI:2447684	Tg(Wnt1-cre/Esr1)10Rth	This transgene expresses a tamoxifen inducible form of a Cre recombinase/estrogen receptor fusion protein. The Wnt1 regulatory sequences initially direct expression in the midbrain. After neural tube closure, expression occurs in the dorsal and ventral midlines of the midbrain and caudal diencephalon, the midbrain-hindbrain junction and in the dorsal spinal cord.
MGI:1891524	Tg(Wnt3)7Gsb	Transgene consists of a hybrid human and mouse Wnt3 gene driven by a keratin 14 promoter.
MGI:2429756	Tg(YAC72)2511Hay	A YAC containing a full-length human huntingtin gene was modified with a 72 CAG repeat expansion in exon 1. The resulting construct (YAC72) was used to generate transgenic mice. The endogenous human HDH promoter directed expression in many tissues with levels in the brain and testes being the highest.
MGI:2387870	Tg(Zp3-cre)1Gwh	A 6 kb fragment encompassing the promoter sequence of Zp3 was adjoined to the cre recombinase coding region and human growth hormone splicing and polyadenylation signals. The Zp3 promoter region was reported to direct expression in oocytes.
MGI:2176052	Tg(Zp3-cre)3Mrt	This transgene expresses Cre recombinase under the control of a mouse zona pellucida 3 promoter. This promoter is active in oocytes.  No expression was detected in somatic tissues.
MGI:2176187	Tg(Zp3-cre)93Knw	This transgene expresses Cre recombinase under the control of a mouse zona pellucida 3 (Zp3) promoter. This promoter is active in the female germ line (oocytes).
MGI:2177210	Wap<tm1(cre)Arge>	A cre gene followed by a neomycin selection cassette was inserted into the 5' noncoding region of the gene.  Activity assays demonstrated that Cre recombinase activity was detectable in mammary gland of heterozygous and homozygous mice.

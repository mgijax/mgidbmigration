Descriptions of the top-level wrapper scripts
# This script runs both B39 and project database migration
1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out

# This script runs non-B39 loads
2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out

# this script runs ALL of B39 loads. This is the script to run on test and prod
3. MGI_part2b.csh >&& MGI_part2b.csh.out

    # These scripts are MGI_part2b.csh split into two pieces
    # so Sophia may view and edit the gff3blat mrkcoord file after 3.1
    # this is for DEV only
    3.1. MGI_part2b-1dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-1dev.csh.out
    3.2. MGI_part2b-2dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-2dev.csh.out

# This is our standard part 3, but with call to snpcacheload which should
# be removed before the Alpha Build on TEST
5. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out

# This is our standard part 4 which runs all the reports
6. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

NOTE: lastrun files are removed prior to each dataload that uses them

Development migration scrumdog bhmgiapp14ld --> mgi-testdb4.scrumdog
For MGI_part2b-1dev.csh:
    1. Sophia need to update GM or Assoc files in TR directory?
    2. genemodelload configure to reload genemodels RELOAD_GENEMODELS=true 
    3. Sophia need to review mgigff3 output? (to update problem seq set and/or
        gff3blat coord file?, if so publish)

For MGI_part2b-2dev.csh:
    1. straingenemodelload configure to load B6 and MGP: B6_ONLY=false

Run:
    1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out
    2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out
    3. IF Sophia NEEDS TO REVIEW mgigff3 output 
        3a. MGI_part2b-1dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-1dev.csh.out
        3b. If Sophia updates problem seq set, she should publish
        3c. If Sophia updates gff3blat coordinate file, 
            she should place in /data/mrkcoord/current
        3c. run MGI_part2b-2dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-2dev.csh.out
    4. If Sophia DOES NOT NEED TO REVIEW mgigff3 output, etc.
        Run MGI_part2b.csh >& MGI_part2b.csh.out - 
            this script runs everything in 2b-1dev and 2b-2dev and eliminates 
            a second mgigff3/refresh call
    5. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out
    6. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

Alpha migration on TEST bhmgidevapp01 --> bhmgidevdb01.prod
For MGI_part2b.csh: 
    1. straingenemodelload configure to load B6 and MGP: B6_ONLY=false
    2. genemodelload configure to reload genemodels RELOAD_GENEMODELS=true
    3. tag/install mgidbmigration
    4. copy from bhmgiapp14ld:/data/mrkcoord/current to 
            bhmgidevapp01:/data/mrkcoord/current - sc done 5/10
        a) blat.c4am_Load.txt
        b) DNA_Segments_with_PrimerPairs_39.txt
        c) FANTOM5_C4AM.txt
        d) mgi_collection_coords_39.txt
        e)  MGI_non-Gene_non-Pseudogene_39.txt
    5. copy problem seq set file from scrum server - added to the migration - directory won't exist til Dave does installs
    6. We are going with what Sophia currently has for GMs/Assocs in the TR directories. Genemodelload
        is configured to those directories on the branch TR 13291/NCBI TRi 13291/ENSEMBL

For MGI_Part3.csh:
    1. rm call to snpcacheload, this is run on different server on test and prod
    2. configure snpcacheload to out of sync mode, this has been done on the branch Configuration.default

Run:
    1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out
    2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out
    3. MGI_part2b.csh >& MGI_part2b.csh.out
    4. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out
    5. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

Production migration:
For MGI_part2b.csh:
    1. straingenemodelload configure to load B6 and MGP: B6_ONLY=false - Dave
    2. genemodelload configure to reload genemodels RELOAD_GENEMODELS=true - Dave
    3. rm two calls to copydownloads.sh ensembl/ncbi, tag/install mgidbmigration
        these copy from production to current server. Sharon - done 
    4. Note: there are calls to ${GENEMODELLOAD}/bin/copyinputs.sh in this 
        script for both ensembl and ncbi that need to run
    5. copy from bhmgiapp14ld:/data/mrkcoord/current to 
            bhmgiapp01:/data/mrkcoord/current - Sharon done
        a) blat.c4am_Load.txt
        b) DNA_Segments_with_PrimerPairs_39.txt
        c) FANTOM5_C4AM.txt
        d) mgi_collection_coords_39.txt
        e)  MGI_non-Gene_non-Pseudogene_39.txt
    6. scp problem seq set file added to the migration - directory won't exist til Dave does installs
For MGI_Part3.csh
    1. configure snpcacheload to out of sync mode - this is done on master
Run:
    1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out
    2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out
    3. MGI_part2b.csh >& MGI_part2b.csh.out
    4. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out
    5. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

tables to remove from MGD:

MGI_AttributeHistory (TR1463 : Sequences As Objects)
  This table was created in order to save the history of changes to sequence attributes
  I believe this table, and references to it, can be removed
  see: read-only source, lib_java_dla
  see: /lib_java_dla/java/org/jax/mgi/dbs/mgd/loads/Seq*

MLD_PhysMap (only 52 rows)
  I believe this table, and references to it, can be removed

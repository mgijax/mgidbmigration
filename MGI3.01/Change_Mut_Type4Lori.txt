MGI:1860759	Fts	The Ft mutation is the result of a transgene integration into mouse chromosome 8.  The transgene integration event resulted in a deletion of 1.6 Mb of genomic sequences, covering coding regions for six genes.  Among these are the genes included in the ent ire IroquoisB (IrxB) gene cluster. 	Transgene induced	Transgenic (random, gene disruption)
MGI:1861103	Hfm	A ~23 Kb deletion on chromosome 10 occured at the integration site of a transgene that expressed myelin basic protein.

MGI:1861589	Wo	The transgenic construct contains a human vasopressin promoter region adjoined to a 1.9 kb fragment of a v-src gene from the Schmidt-Ruppin A strain of RSV. Southern blot analysis indicated that a single copy of the construct integrated into the genome of  founder mice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	Transgene induced	Transgenic (random, gene disruption)
MGI:1861640	Fancl<gcd>	The gcd mutation was identified as a transgene insertion that also deletes approximately 150 kb of genomic sequence at the insertion site.  This deletion removes exons 4-14 of Fancl and also removes exons 2-11 of a neighboring gene Vrk2.  A transgene expr essing Vrk2 that was introduced into homozygous mice failed to rescue the phenotype, suggesting that the deletion of Fancl was solely responsible for the phenotype seen in gcd mice.

MGI:1888983	Lepr<Tg(Mth11)1Aig>	The mutation was caused by insertion of a transgene.  The construct contained 2.3 kb of the rabbit smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoter region.  The deletion extends from intron 17 into the 3' region of the gene.                                      	Transgene induced	Transgenic (random, gene disruption)
MGI:1889309	awg<Tg(GBts1env)832Pkw>	In this transgenic line, a construct designed to express the viral envelope protein of a variant of the Moloney murine leukemia virus under the control of a human granzyme B promoter inserted randomly into an unidentified gene.  Seven to eight copies of t he transgene integrated in a head to tail orientation, and expression of the transgenic construct was restricted to the thymus in this line.  No abnormalities were observed in other transgenic lines generated from the same construct, and hemizygous mice a ppear healthy, confirming that the mutant phenotype is a result of the construct integration event in this line.

MGI:2151877	Pcdh15<av-TgN2742Rpw>	A construct consisting of a human beta-actin promoter driving expression of a rat lectin cDNA was injected into fertilized eggs.  The construct integrated in multiple tandem copies into the coding region of the Pcdh15 gene, disupting the coding seqence fo r the fourth cdh domain.  Truncated transcripts are produced from this allele that are smaller than normal size due to the SV40 poly(A) site that is present in the transgene.

Other transgenic lines generated using this construct did not correlate  with the associated mutant phenotype of mice bearing the transgene in this line, suggesting that the transgene insertion was a mutational event.                                                                                                              	Transgene induced	Transgenic (random, gene disruption)
MGI:2157527	TgN737Rpw	A random transgene insertional event resulted in the deletion of approximately 2.7kb at the transgene insertion site in an intron of the gene, but no exons were deleted.  Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of a 3.2 and 7.0kb transcript was ab olished in RNA from all tissues derived from homozygous mice.

MGI:2158467	Bmp7<Tg(BCL2)114Cro>	A transgene expressing human BCL2 under the control of the human BCL2 promoter and immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer randomly inserted into the mouse Bmp7 gene.  PCR and Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the insertion resulted in a disruption or  deletion of exon 3.  RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that no transcript containing sequnces from exons 4-7 could be detected, suggesting that no functional protein can be produced from this allele.                                                             	Transgene induced	Transgenic (random, gene disruption)
MGI:2179544	Relb<Tg(H2K/GH1)106Bri>	The random insertion of a transgene just downstream of the exon encoding the Rel domain disrupted the gene.  RT-PCR analysis of RNA derived from slpeen and thymus of homozygous mice demonstrated that no detectable transcript was expressed from this allele .  Immunohistochemistry experiments on sections of thymus and spleen of homozygous mice confirmed that no detectable encoded protein was present.

MGI:2180081	Dnahc5<Tg1Htz>	This mutation resulted from the random integration of a transgene (not identified in paper).  RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that a transcript with the transgene replacing sequences between exons 16 and 22 was expressed, resulting in the generation of a sto p codon at the start of the transgene. The predicted translated product of this fusion transcript lacks all of the known functional domains of the protein.

MGI:2386579	Tg(Tcf1-P291fsinsC)2Kya	This transgene was constructed by ligating the rat insulin II promoter to human cDNA associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type III (MODY III).  The human genetic sequence included a mutation found in a subject with MODY III, and had a fra meshift mutation of codon pro291,  resulting from insertion of a C in a poly(C) tract. (The investigators designated this mutation P291fsinsC, proline 291 frameshift insertion C.) In human subjects the mutation was predicted to result in a mutant trunca ted protein of 340 amino acids.  Two transgenic mouse lines were established, one with 5 copies of the transgene, and one with 20.  As both lines showed a similar phenotype, only one is described below, the line with 20 copies of the transgene.           	Transgene induced	Transgenic (random, expressed)

The endogenous promoter was replaced with a promoter contai ning a 36-bp deletion in the 5'-untranslated region.  This resulted in a construct that contained the gene's regulatory elements, allowing expression in the placenta prenatally and the forestomach postnatally, while the 36-bp deletion in the promoter allo wed distinction of this transcript from that of native transcript.  RNase protection showed transgene transcript in placentas, but not fetuses, of transgenic animals.  Enzymatic activity of the protein product was increased in the placenta, but not in the  fetus, of transgenic mice compared to nontransgenic animals.

MGI:2158498	Bmpr1b<Tg(ACTB-flp)4917Dym>	A random insertion of a transgene expressing Flp recombinase under the control of a human beta-actin promoter resulted in the mutation.  Exon 1 and flanking sequence are deleted and replaced with two head-to-tail copies of the transgene.  RT-PCR analysis  on olfactory epithelium and limb tissue of homozygous mice revealed that this mutation results in the loss of transcript expression only in the limb.  The authors propose that the use of two promoters in the gene can account for the partial loss, and that  the mutation affects only one of these promoters.

This allele expresses -galactosidase in a pattern that   reflects the expression of wild type Fgf3 mRNA. RT-PCR analyses of homozygous mutant embryos detected no transcripts.

MGI:2149670	Ephb2<tm2Paw>	Insertion of a LacZ-neomycin resistance cassette in-frame at codon 622. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal Ephb2 antibody did not detect protein in cell surface immunoprecipitates of primary brain cultures from homozygous mutant neonates (P4), howev er a polyclonal beta-galactosidase antibody did detect a novel 200 kDa protein in these cultures. The authors propose that the mutant allele produces a fusion receptor protein comprised of the extracellular, transmembrane, and juxtamembrane domains (amino  acids 1-621) linked to beta-galactosidase, and that this mutated receptor lacks the entire tyrosine kinase catalytic and C-terminal domains (amino acids 622-707).

MGI:2183403	Fgf14<tm1Dor>	A cassette containing lacZ and neo genes was inserted five codons into exon 2. The construct was designed such that a fusion protein, containing the alternatively spliced exon 1 and lacZ product, would be produced. The insertion deleted the majority of ex on 2 and all of exon 3, which encode residues conserved in the FGF family. Transcript was undetected via Northern blot analysis of total cerebellar RNA obtained from homozygous mutant mice. While in situ hybridization and RNA blot analysis showed similar  mRNA expression patterns between the mutant and endogenous alleles, protein expression patterns were shown to vary via X-gal staining.

MGI:2183651	Sp4<tm1Sus>	Exons 2 and 3, encoding the amino terminal activation domains (residues 4 through 557), were deleted by the insertion of a cassette containing IRES-lacZ and neo genes. Northern blot analysis of total RNA obtained from brain and heart tissue showed an abse nce of transcript in homozygous mutant mice. A lack of encoded protein was determined by Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against the carboxy terminal. Expression of the lacZ transgene was controlled by the promoter of the endogenous gene.	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (Reporter)
MGI:2183715	Rxrg<tm1Ysa>	A cassette containing lacZ and neo genes was inserted into the isoform-specific exon 2. By targeting exon 2, transcription of the isoform most prominent in brain tissue is ablated, while the isoform which is produced from a transcript in which exon 1b spl ices to exon 3, and is most abundant in skeletal muscle, is unaffected. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the transcript encoding the targeted isoform was absent and that the level of transcript encoding the isoform that is most prominent in skeletal muscle  was normal. X-gal staining showed the lacZ transgene to be expressed via the endogenous promoter.

Expression of the CDP-lacZ fusion protein was verified by Western blot analysis of mouse embyronic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from homozgyous mutants.  The fusion protein lacks gene repression activity and is therefore a null allele.

MGI:3026702	Efnb3<tm1.1Henk>	The frt-flanked neo cassette was excised from Efnb2<tm1Henk> via FLP-mediated recombination, leaving the loxP flanked lacZ cassette in exon 5. The lacZ cassette disrupted codons 264 through 340 which make up the majority of the cytoplasmic domain. Biochem ical analysis indicated that the expected EFNB2-beta-gal protein, in which the endogenous cytoplasmic domain is replaced with beta-gal, was produced. This mutation leaves forward signaling intact and ablates reverse signaling. The expression pattern of la cZ was observed to be to similar to that of the endogenous gene.

MGI:2657140	Ace<tm3Keb>	A neo cassette immediately followed by a 2.3 kb albumin promoter/enhancer was inserted downstream of the endogenous somatic promoter and upstream of exon 1 by homologous recombination. The targeting construct was designed such that transcription of the so matic isoform would be controlled by the inserted albumin promoter, which drives expression in the liver. Protein was undetected in all but two of the somatic tissues tested. There was 87-fold increase in the hepatic protein level whereas the renal protei n level was approximately 14% that of wild type mice. The expression of the testes isoform was unaffected.

MGI:1857183	Icam1<tm1Bay>	A neomycin resistance cassette was inserted into exon 5 of the gene. Subsequent analysis reported by King, et. al. (J:25530) revealed the presence of alternatively spliced transcripts in both wild type and homozygous mutant mice. Protein expression was de tected in mutant mice in medullary stromal cells of the thymus, as well as in the lung and spleen. Variable splicing of exons 2 through 6, encoding extracellular Ig domains, results in the production of 3 isoforms (2-6, 3-6, 4-6, where the numbers refer t o spliced exons) in mutant mice. In addition to the 3 found in mutant mice, 2 other alternative splice forms including exon 5 were identified in wild type mice. The reading frame and exons 1 and 7, encoding the signal sequence and both the transmembrane a nd cytosolic domains, are left intact in each isoform.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857212	Ldlr<tm1Her>	Insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette into exon 4 disrupted the Ldlr gene.  The authors predict that the targeted allele would encode a truncated non-functional protein that will not bind LDL, and that lacks a membrane spanning segment. Immunoblot a nalysis of liver membranes detected a truncated protein in homozygous mutant animals.

MGI:1857216	Mag<tm1Rod>	A neomycin resistance cassette was inserted into exon 5 of the gene.   Mutant mice showed a complete lack of mRNA and protein in the central nervous system for the targeted gene.  Nerves from the peripheral nervous system also lacked protein for the targe ted gene.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857218	Mos<tm1Ev>	A neomycin resistance cassette was inserted into the middle of the single coding exon of the gene, introducing an amber stop codon into the reading frame and terminating translation upstream of sequences essential for kinase activity.                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857219	Myf5<tm1Jae>	A PGK-neomycin cassette was inserted into exon 1 of the gene, disrupting the reading frame.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857222	Ncam1<tm1Cgn>	A neommycin resistance cassette replaced most of exons 3 and 4 and the intervening intron. Ribonuclease protection assays did not detect wild type or read-through transcripts or alternative or cryptic splicing in brain tissue from homozygous mutant mice.  Western blot analysis of brain tissue using a monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal rabbit serum did not detect protein in homozygous mutant mice. Similarly, immunostaining did not detect protein in mutant olfactory bulb.                                    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857224	Nfe2<tm1Sho>	A PGK-neomycin cassette was inserted into exon 3, immediately upstream of sequences required for DNA binding and protein dimerization.  Absence of intact mRNA and protein were demonstrated by Northern and immunoblot analyses, respectively.                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857225	Nfkb1<tm1Bal>	Insertion of a PGK-neomycin resistance cassette into exon 6 disrupted the gene.  Exon 6 encodes the p105 precursor of the p50 subunit of the encoded transcription factor.  The authors predict that this allele produces a truncated polypeptide that cannot b ind with DNA, or dimerize with itself or other kappaB binding motifs.

MGI:1857226	Ngfr<tm1Jae>	A neomycin selection cassette was inserted into the third exon of the gene, disrupting the sequences encoding cysteine repeats 2, 3, and 4.  Northern blot analysis revealed that the mutant gene did not yield a full length mRNA, however subsequent RT-PCR a nalysis, described in J:71955, detected an endogenous alternative transcript which lacks exon 3. Western blot analysis showed that the full length isoform was absent in homozygous mutant mice, but an isoform lacking cysteine repeats 2, 3, and 4 was presen t in both wild and mutant mice. In vitro experiments showed the persisting isoform to be a transmembrane protein that cannot bind neurotrophins but interacts with tyrosine kinase receptors.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857229	Nos3<tm1Unc>	A 1.2 kb neomycin cassette replaced 129 bp of exon 12 of the gene.  This disrupted the calmodulin binding site of the protein and introduced a premature stop codon into the transcripts.  Immunohistochemisty of heart and kidney sections from homozygous mut ant mice confirmed that no detectable encoded protein was present.

MGI:1857617	Wnt5a<tm1Amc>	Exon 2 was disrupted at codon 31 by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette.                                                                                                                                                                            	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857621	Crabp1<tm1Adg>	A genomic fragment containing exons 1 and 2 was replaced with a hygromycin selection cassette inserted in reverse transcriptional orientation relative to the gene.  RT-PCR and northern blot analysis on RNA derived from homozygous embryos confirmed that no  detectable transcripts were produced from this allele.                                                                                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857622	Rara<tm1Ipc>	A neomycin cassette was inserted into exon 8, which encodes the common receptor region B.  This disruption is predicted to prevent the synthesis of all Rara isoforms.  RNAase protection analysis of homozygous E13.5 embryos failed to detect wild- type RNA  transcripts and immunoblot analysis failed to detect protein in in extracts from homozygous E13.5 embryos.

MGI:1857623	Rarb<tm1Ipc>	Ablation of the expression of the most abundant isoform, Rarbeta2, encoded by this locus was achieved in two steps. First, all of the in-frame start codons for the Rarbeta2 isoform were eliminated by site-specific mutagenesis of nucleotides 459 through 49 1.  Second, a neomycin resistance gene was inserted into the first exon of the Rarbeta2 isoform, exon 4. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, using isoform specific primers and antibodies, showed a lack of Rarbeta2 mRNA and protein, as well as normal levels  of transcript and protein corresponding to the other isoforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857625	Apob<tm3Sgy>	A sequence-insertion vector was used to interrupt the coding sequence after exon 4 and is predicted to result in a truncated protein produced from this allele.

MGI:1857631	Cbx2<tm1Cim>	A neomycin resistance cassette replaced exons 1-4.  RT-PCR analysis confirmed the absence of the transcript in homozygous mice.                                                                                                                                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857632	Bmi1<tm1Brn>	The sequences encoding the ATG start codon, the zinc finger motif, and part of the helix-turn-helix motif were replaced either with a hygromycin-resistance cassette or one that conveyed neomycin-resistance.                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857633	Rnf110<tm1Hko>	A neomycin resistance cassette replaced exon 5, which contains the transcriptional initiation codon and encodes the RING finger domain.  RNAse protection assays demonstrated that a truncated transcript is produced from this allele in homozygous mice, but  the authors predict that no functional protein can be translated.                                                                                                                                                                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857634	Gbx2<tm1Mrt>	A neomycin resistance cassette and one loxP site were inserted into a BamH1 site in an intron; a second loxP site was inserted downstream of the stop codon.   To obtain mice in which the floxed region of the gene was deleted, the authors crossed mice hete rozygous for this mutation with mice that expressed Cre DNA recombinase in the egg or early embryo under control of promoter elements from the mouse Zp3 gene or human beta-actin gene, respectively.  The resulting allele, Gbx2<tm1Mrt>, lacks the sequences  encoding the homeobox.

MGI:1857661	Hoxd<tm2Ddu>	This allele involved the use of an embryonic stem cell line carrying an ectopic Hoxd11/lacZ transgene located between the resident Hoxd13 and  Evx2 genes and flanked at the 3' end by a unique loxP site.  A loxPneoloxP cassette was recombined on the same c hromosome, downstream of resident  Hoxd11.  After treatment with Cre recombinase, the resultant deletion removed Hoxd11, Hoxd12, and Hoxd13, but brought the ectopic Hoxd11/lacZ transgene back to the original Hoxd11 locus.  Mice homozygous for this deficie ncy lacked Hoxd11, Hoxd12, and Hoxd13 loci.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857775	Adcy1<tm1Drs>	A neomycin selection casssette replaced a genomic fragment including part of exon 1.   Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the transcript was not detectable in RNA from homozygous mice.                                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857789	Dlx5<tm1Jlr>	Insertion of a PGK-neomycin resistance cassette replaced 2.2kb of sequence including exons 1 and 2. The mutant allele is predicted to express a truncated protein that lacks the N-terminus, which includes 43 amino acids of the homeodomain.                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857792	Itga3<tm1Jak>	A neomycin resistance cassette was inserted into the site that corresponds to cDNA nucleotide 1065.

MGI:1857793	Itga6<tm1Egl>	A neomycin cassette replaced a genomic fragment that contains three coding exons of the gene corresponding to amino acids 62-194.   Northern analysis of total RNA extracted from homozygous tissue showed the absence of full length message, and a presence o f a truncated mRNA that should not yield a functional protein.  Immunohistochemical analysis did not detect any protein produce from this allele in tissue sections derived from from homozygous embryos.                                                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857796	Shh<tm1Chg>	A PGK neomycin cassette replaced exon 2 and portions of the flanking intronic sequences in the Shh gene.                                                                                                                                                       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857797	Gli<tm1Alj>	A neomycin resistance cassette replaced exons 9 to 11, which encode part of zinc finger 1, zinc fingers 2 - 5, and 43 adjacent amino acids.  Northern blots of total RNA from E13.5 embryos using a cDNA probe 3' to the zinc fingers resulted in detection of  2 transcripts in wild type embryos and only one smaller broad band in homozygous mutant embryos.  Further analysis by RT-PCR followed by sequencing of the products showed that the mutant allele produced a transcript that spliced around the neomycin insert  from exon 8 - 12.  The authors state that as a result, the mutant allele could not encode for a protein with DNA-binding activity, but could produce a mutant protein lacking amino acids 269 - 437.                                                          	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1857798	Rbl1<tm1Mru>	The Rbl1 gene was disrupted by insertion of a PGK neomycin resistance cassette into exon 4 immediately downstream of the sequence encoding amino acid 165.  Northern analysis of embryonic fibroblast confluent cultures detected a slightly truncated Rbl1 tra nscript in homozygous mutant E14.5 embryos. The authors propose that the truncated transcript would be initiated from the PGK promoter. Immunoblot analysis using antisera reactive with the carboxyl-terminal 18 amino acids of RBL1 did not detect protein in  homozygous mutant embryos.

Northern blots of brain homogenates from homozygous mutant mice showed minimally detectable truncated Aqp4 transcripts.  Western blots of bra in homogenates from homozygous mutant mice showed no detectable Aqp4 protein.  Immunocytochemistry of renal tissue from homozygous mutant mice showed no detectable Aqp4 protein.

MGI:1857809	Scp2<tm1Usee>	Exon 14 was disrupted by the insertion of a neomycin cassette. Sequence analysis of truncated transcript identified by Northern analyis, showed that an aberrant splice pattern resulted in the excision of exon 14. The joining of exons 13 and 15 resulted in  a frameshift mutation which introduced a stop codon in exon 15, upstream of an essential peroxisomal targeting signal. Western analysis revealed an absence of normal protein in the livers of homozygous mutant mice.                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1932738	Psen1<tm1Hko>	Replacement of exon 9, encoding a proteolytic cleavage site, and flanking intronic sequence with a neomycin cassette.  A reduced level of mRNA was detectable by RT-PCR from this allele; sequence analysis revealed splicing from exon 8 to exon 10 without fr ameshift.  However, Western blot analysis revealed that expression of the protein was abolished, and this allele is suggested to be a null.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1933205	Notch2<tm1Grid>	This is a hypomorphic allele.  A neomycin resistance cassette replaced 0.4 kb of sequence, including part of the exon encoding EGF repeat 14, the splice donor site at the 3' end of this exon, and 0.3 kb of intron.  mRNA species are detected in homozygous  mutant embryos that appear to be the result of inframe splicing around the neomycin cassette.  Proteins derived from these transcripts are predicted to have a deletion of one or two EGF repeats.

MGI:1933265	Ell<tm1Hhi>	Insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette into exon 1 disrupted the Ell gene.                                                                                                                                                                                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1933294	Tob1<tm1Tya>	A PGK-neomycin resistance cassette was inserted into the only exon of the gene. Western blot analysis of primary embryonic fibroblasts detected only one of the two wild type forms of the protein in homozygous mutant mice. Northern blot analysis did not de tect transcript in osteoblast lineage cells derived from calvariae of homozygous mutant newborns. Also, BMP2-stimulated DNA synthesis was enhanced in these cells compared to wild type.                                                                       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1933334	Pdgfb<tm1Cbet>	A PGK-neomycin cassette deleted part of exon 3 and all of  exon 4.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:1933748	Atm<tm1Fwa>	Exons 50 - 52 were replaced by a neomycin cassette.  RT-PCR anaylsis detected two transcripts. One splices exon 49 to a site within the neomycin gene, resulting in an in-frame stop codon.  The second splices exon 49 in-frame to exon 53.  However, protein  was not detected by western blot in thymus or brain of homozygous mutant mice.

MGI:2137311	Mecp2<tm1.1Bird>	Insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette into the Mecp2 gene introduced loxP sites that flank exons 3 and 4, and added an intron and polyadenylation signal from the human beta globin gene. A CMV-Cre mediated recombination event in the germline then rem oved exons 3 and 4. Northern blot analysis did not detect Mecp2 mRNA in tissues of mutant male mice (-/y), nor did Western blot analysis detect protein in these tissues.                                                                                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2137330	Nr1h4<tm1Gonz>	Mice with a targeted deletion of the last exon encoding the ligand binding domain and all of the 3' untranslated region were produced as follows:  A loxP site was inserted in the intron 5' to the last exon and a loxP-flanked neomycin cassette was inserted  3' to the last exon.  After production of chimeric founder mice, F1 mice were mated to Tg(EIIa-Cre)1Lmgd mice to produce offspring that carried a recombined deletion of the last exon and neomycin cassette. No Nr1h4 protein product is detected in liver ti ssue from these null mice although an aberrant transcript appears to be generated.

MGI:2149065	Add2<tm1Llp>	A neomycin resistance cassette replaced a genomic fragment containing exons 9 to 13. Western blot analysis did not detect protein in RBC ghosts from homozygous mutant mice. Northern blot analysis using a probe for exons 9 to 12 did not detect transcript i n homozygous mutant brain, spleen, or kidney. Northern blots using a neoR gene probe indicated that in homozygous mutant mice, transcripts are produced from antisense neoR sequence, and in spleen membranes the 4kb chimeric transcript is translated into a  55kDa protein that is detectable by Western blot. RT-PCR analysis detected a transcript that is a direct splice from exon 8 to exon 14, and which in homozygous mutant brain and spleen does not produce a polypeptide that is detectable by Western blot analy sis.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2154689	Col11a2<tm1Mne>	A neomycin-resistance cassette was inserted between restriction sites in exons 27 and 28. A short, aberrant trancript was produced from the targeted allele, which could be detected by Northern blotting. However, translation of the full-length protein is p redicted to result in a truncated protein, due to the presence of termination codons.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2154694	Sgcd<tm1Kcam>	A neomycin resistance cassette replaced exon 2, which encodes 63 amino acids of the intracellular domain and the entire transmembrane domain.  Northern blot analysis revealed that a transcript lacking exon 2 sequences is produced from this allele, but no  protein was detected in skeletal muscle membrane enriched preparations of homozygous mice by western blot analysis.                                                                                                                                            	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2155092	Cd3e<tm1Mal>	A PGK-neomycin cassette replaced most of exon 5, which encodes the extracellular domain. Northern analysis detected a faint, aberrant ~1.3kb transcript in thymocytes of homozygous mutant mice. PCR studies of cDNA synthesized from total thymocyte RNA did n ot detect wild type mRNA in homozygous mutant mice using an internal, exon 8 oligo probe. However, these studies did detect a faint truncated transcript in homozygous mutant thymocytes, indicating that exon 5 was skipped in splicing events in the mutant a llele. Western blot analysis of homozygous mutant thymocytes using a rabbit antiserum to the cytoplasmic carboxy terminal ten amino acids detected a small amount of a truncated protein.

MGI:2155244	Snrpn<tm1Cbr>	Insertion of a PGK-neomycin resistance cassette into the paternally derived maternal gene replaced 0.27kb of coding sequence including exon 6 and portions of exons 5 and 7. Northern blot analysis of heterozygous ES cells using a cDNA probe for exons 7-10   detected a fusion transcript produced by the disrupted allele that is larger than the wild-type transcript. Northern blot analysis of brain tissue from heterozygous mutant mice using a neo probe also detected the larger transcript, and did not detect any  transcript using a probe for the deleted sequences. Immunoblot analysis using human antisera did not detect protein in brain from heterozygous mutant mice.

MGI:2155444	Hsf1<tm1Ijb>	A 1.8kb genomic fragment containing all or part of 6 exons was replaced by a neomycin resistance cassette.  These sequences encode half the DNA binding domain and the adjacent oligomerization domain of the protein. Northern blot analysis on RNA derived fr om homozygous embryonic cells demonstated that a mutant, truncated transcript was produced from this allele.  However, western blot analysis indicated that no protein was detectable in cells derived from homozygous embryos.                                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2155446	Mdfi<tm1Krt>	A neomycin selection cassette replaced exon 5 coding sequences, corresponding to amino acids 162-246 required for protein-protein interactions with MyoD family members.

MGI:2155483	Madh1<tm1Rob>	A PGK-neomycin resistance cassette replaced most of the first coding exon and 30bp of 3' flanking sequence, including the initiation codon and sequences encoding most of the MH1 domain. Northern analysis of 9.5dpc homozygous embryos detected a shorter tra nscript, but not the wild type transcript, using a probe for the 3' UTR. Western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes the MH2 domain did not detect intact or truncated protein in 9.5dpc homozygous embryos.	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2155485	Madh1<tm2.1Rob>	This allele is a derivative of Madh1<tm2Rob>. To generate this allele, mice carrying the Madh1<tm2Rob> allele were mated to mice carrying a Cre transgene controlled by a mouse protamine 1 promoter that directs Cre-recombinase expression specifically to th e male germline. An in vivo Cre-mediated excision removed all of the first coding exon and approximately 2kb of 5' and 3' flanking genomic sequences, and left a single loxP and EcoRI site in the locus. Northern analysis of 9.5dpc homozygous embryos detect ed a shorter transcript, but not the wild type transcript, using a probe for the 3' UTR. Western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes the MH2 domain did not detect intact or truncated protein in 9.5dpc homozygous embryos.

MGI:2155771	Psen1<tm1Psgh>	A loxP flanked neomycin resistance cassette was introduced approximately 0.2 kb downstream of exon 5 of the gene.   The presence of cryptic splice sites within the neomycin cassette resulted in the generation of low quantities of unstable transcripts, whi ch lacked an open reading frame after exon 5.  The authors state these transcripts result in no detectable protein in ES cells or in the brains of animals homozygous for this construct.

All if the somatic coding regions downstream of the neomycin cassette were inserted into intron 12.   However, somatic isoforms expressed from this allele do not contain the C-terminal hydrophobic tail.  Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis revealed that a cryptic splice site caused a 40bp insertion into the transcript and introduced an in frame stop codon .  Western blot and activity assays demonstrated an absence of protein in tissues of homozygous mice.

MGI:2159430	Trp53<tm1Ldo>	Insertion of a PGK-hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) expression cassette introduced into exon 7 an A to T transversion mutation that predicts an Arg245Trp substitution, and deleted 20 kb of sequence that included exons 1-6 and a large undefine d upstream region. The authors propose that an unknown upstream promoter initiates a chimeric mRNA containing a 55-nucleotide leader spliced onto exons 7-11. This message contains three in-frame AUG codons. The third AUG codon is a viable translation init iation site, which may produce a C-terminal protein fragment. RT-PCR analyses detect expression of this allele in several tissues of heterozygous mutant mice, albeit at lower levels than the wild type allele. Studies of in vitro transcription and translat ion of a construct containing cDNA from this allele detected expression of a predicted 24 kDa protein.

MGI:2159468	Cpb2<tm1Mng>	A PGK-neomycin resistance cassette replaced half of exon 8 and all of exon 9, sequences that encode zinc and substrate binding sites. RT-PCR analysis using primers that span the entire coding region detected a truncated transcript in liver from homozygous  mutant mice. Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptide encoded by exon 5  did not detect protein in plasma from homozygous mutant mice.

MGI:2159609	Inpp5b<tm1Nbm>	A truncated PGK-neomycin resistance cassette and a 17 bp sequence that contains stop codons in all three frames was introduced into sequence corresponding to exon 13 of human gene. Northern blot analysis detected both forms of transcript in brain from 3 w eek old homozygous mice. In kidney, spleen, and liver from these mice, both transcripts were reduced or absent. RT-PCR studies using primers spanning the region of the exon carrying the PGK-neo insertion detected markedly reduced amounts of a shorter prod uct amplified from this allele in kidney, spleen, and liver from homozygous mutant mice compared with wild type mice, whereas in brain apparently equal amounts of the wild type and the shorter product were amplified. The shorter product was found to be la cking a 30 bp sequence that could be translated to make a protein that lacks ten amino acid residues in a highly conserved domain shared by OCRL. The authors propose that the 17 bp insertion created a consensus 5' splice site that would splice out the PGK -neo sequence, the three-frame stop codons, and 30 nucleotides from the 3' part of the exon.

Northern blot analysis using a 3' UTR probe did not dete ct either transcript in testis from homozygous mutant mice. RT-PCR analysis of testis with primers flanking exon 15 detected a deletion of 137 bp in the RNA transcribed by this allele.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2180079	Acadl<tm1Uab>	A gap-repair insertion was used to duplicate exons 3 and 4.  Analysis of the mutant cDNA showed a duplication of exons 3 and 4 as well as the excision of the neomycin selection gene and the plasmid sequence.  Northern blot analysis demonstrated normal exp ression levels of mutant transcript.  No protein was detected by immunoblots in isolates from liver mitochondria of homozygous mutant animals.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2180089	Actb<tm1Bhr>	A promoterless hygromycin-lacZ fusion gene with a splice acceptor was introduced into the first intron of the beta actin locus. The presence of normal transcript in homozygous mutants suggests that the fusion gene is sporadically excised during splicing,  resulting in a hypomorphic allele. Expression analysis indicated that the integration event does not result in ubiquitous expression of Beta galactosidase.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2180097	Adcyap1r1<tm1Bbt>	A neomycin selection cassette replaced a 2.3-kb fragment containing exons 8 through 11.  The neo gene was situated in the reverse transcriptional orientation and was excised during the splicing of the transcript, resulting in a frameshift that introduces  a stop codon in exon 12.  A truncated transcript was observed by RT-PCR analysis.  A 90% decrease in binding of a radio-labeled ligand in homozygous mutants was observed versus wild-type, as well as an absence of cAMP production stimulation.              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2180099	Adh1<tm2Gdu>	Exons 7 through 9 and the polyadenylation signal were deleted by the insertion of a PGK-hygro gene downstream of exon 6.  This construct was developed by altering a previously described construct, tm1Due, containing a neomycin selection gene, for use in t he generation of a double knockout.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2180102	Adh7<tm1Gdu>	A PGK-neo cassette replaced the promoter and exons 1 through 6.  Northern blot analysis showed an absence of transcript in extracts isolated from the stomach and skin tissue of homozygous mutant mice.  Western blot analysis confirmed a lack of encoded pro tein and normal levels of other alcohol dehydrogenases in homozygous mutant animals.                                                                                                                                                                           	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2180105	Tlx3<tm1Sjk>	A PGK-neo cassette was inserted into exon 1.   RNA in situ analysis confirmed the lack of gene expression in homozygous mice.

MGI:2180111	Accn1<tm1Wsh>	A neomycin cassette was inserted to disrupt two exons encoding the second transmembrane domain, which is common to both splice variants, as well as a channel pore. Transcripts were not detected in the brains of homozygous mutant mice. Neither in situ hybr idization nor immunostaining detected protein in the large or small dorsal root ganglion neurons of homozygous animals.                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2180115	Aebp1<tm1Mdl>	A PGK-neo cassette was used to replace exons 7 through the majority of 16.  The deleted region encodes the discoidin domain a portion of the carboxypeptidase-like domain. Northern and Western analyses of homozygous embryos showed an absence of normal mRNA  and protein expression, respectively. Because the antiserum used for the Western analysis was raised against the C-terminus, it is possible that a truncated protein was present in heterozygous mutants, though the authors believe that there is no gain-of- function.

MGI:2180863	Chk<tm1Hua>	A construct was created in which a floxed neomycin cassette was inserted immediately upstream of the exons encoding the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain. An additional loxP site was inserted at the 3' terminal of this region. Transient transfection of ES  cells with plasmids expressing cre-recombinase generated an allele which lacked both the inserted neomycin gene and the catalytic domain encoding exon. Northern blot analyses using various probes showed that a truncated transcript lacking the catalytic do main was produced in homozygous mutant mice. Additionally, absence of the tyrosine kinase domain encoding region was confirmed by RT-PCR.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2181054	Coil<tm1Agm>	A 10-kb region spanning exon 2 through the stop codon in exon 7 was replaced by a neomycin selection cassette. The deleted region encoded the nuclear localization signals, serine patches, and a conserved carboxyl terminus. Northern blot analysis using pro bes corresponding to regions outside of the deleted interval showed the presence of a hybrid mRNA. Sequence analysis of the aberrant transcript showed a cryptic splice junction between exon 1 and the inserted neo gene. Western blot analysis using an antib ody raised against the carboxyl terminus showed a lack of normal protein, but could not confirm the absence of an 82 residue peptide putatively translated from the exon 1 fragment. Attempts to generate an antibody for the largely hydrophobic amino terminu s were not successful.

MGI:2182155	Air<tm1Dpb-m>	A 1.2 kb rabbit beta-globin fragment containing a polyadenylation cassette was inserted immediately downstream of the 3.7 kb imprint control element (ICE). The insertion was designed to truncate the RNA product to 4% of its length without disrupting the I CE. While the allele maintains its imprinted status and wild type expression levels, the truncation results in a loss of gene silencing of the Igf2r/Slc22a2/Slc22a3 cluster on the paternal chromosome. An aberrant transcript was identified by RT-PCR analys is. This splice varient involved a splice donor 53 bp downstream of the transcription start site that joined a slice acceptor of transgenic beta-globin exon 3.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182326	Cysltr1<tm1Ykn>	A 278 bp coding region of exon 4 common to both the long and short isoforms of the gene was replaced with a neomycin resistance gene via homologous recombination. Northern blot analysis verified the absence of gene expression in lung of homozygous mutant  animals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182334	Cyp27b1<tm1Star>	A floxed region containing exon 8 was excised via the expression of cre recombinase in vitro. The deleted region encoded the heme-binding domain. RT-PCR analysis of total renal RNA identified the presence of a truncated transcript in homozygous mutant mic e. The absence of active vitamin D3 in serum samples was identified by an radioimmunoassay and indicates that the aberrant transcript present in homozgous mutant mice is non-functional.                                                                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182338	Cyp24a1<tm1Star>	Exons 9 and 10, the latter encoding the heme-binding domain, were replaced with a PGK-neo selection cassette. Transcript was reported to be undetectable in homozygous mutant mice. Neither an immunoassay nor HPLC fractionation followed by a competitive bin ding assay could detect the enzymatic product, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, of the encoded protein in homozygous mutant mice.                                                                                                                                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182340	Hmbs<tm1Uam>	A promoterless neomycin selection cassette was inserted into exon 3, which is common to all isoforms. Hepatic enzymatic activity, the conversion of porphobilinogen to uroporphyrin, was reduced by approximately 50% in heterozygous mice.                    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182346	Hmbs<tm2Uam>	The insertion of a PGK-neo cassette disrupted exon 1, which is specific to isoforms transcribed in non-erythroid cells. RT-PCR analysis showed a lack of transcript containing exon 1, though the expression of a transcript consisting of exon 3 and downstrea m sequence was identified. The expression of this aberrant transcript was reported to be driven by the PGK promoter and was putatively responsible for the hepatic enzymatic activity determined in homozygous mutant mice (reduced by 44.7% from wild type).  	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182347	Hmbs<tm3Uam>	A promoterless neomycin selection cassette with a splice acceptor site in front of the coding region was inserted into intron 1. The construct was designed to generate a hypomorphic allele, in which the transgenic splice acceptor site competes with an end ogenous splice acceptor site in exon 3. Hepatic enzymatic activity, the conversion of porphobilinogen to uroporphyrin, was reduced by 43.4% in heterozygous mutant mice.                                                                                       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182351	Cyp1a2<tm1Dwn>	The insertion of an hprt gene, with the opposite orientation of the endogenous gene, deleted a portion of exon 2 and all of exons 3 through 5. This deleted region encoded the conserved cysteine-containing fragment and the cytochrome P450 tridecapeptide. N orthern blot analysis of total hepatic RNA obtained from beta-naphthoflavone-treated animals showed a lack of transcript in homozygous mutant mice. Failure of homozygous mutant mice to metabolize zoxazolamine, a muscle relaxant, indicated a lack of functi onal protein.

MGI:2182390	Pck1<tm1Lre>	A floxed PGK-neomycin resistance cassette replaced 50 bp of the adipose tissue-specific part of the promoter.                                                                                                                                                  	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182394	Pck1<tm1.1Lre>	This allele is a derivative of Pck1<tm1Lre> in which Cre-mediated recombination removed the floxed PGK-neomycin resistance cassette that in the initial allele had replaced part of the adipose tissue-specific part of the promoter. Northern blot analysis of  fasted homozygous mutant mice detected mRNA in liver and kidney, no mRNA in white adipose tissue, and a decreased level of mRNA in brown adipose tissue. RT-PCR studies using primers for exon 9 and 10 did not detect transcript in white adispose tissue fro m fasted homozygous mutant mice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182396	Pim1<tm1Pwl>	The insertion of a neomycin selection cassette deleted the promoter region, both transcriptional and translational start sites, and a portion of the coding sequence containing an essential lysine residue in the ATP-binding site of the protein kinase domai n. An in vitro autophosphorylation assay showed an absence of phospho-kinase activity in splenocytes obtained from homozygous mutant mice.

MGI:2182403	Dld<tm1Ptl>	Exon 10 was disrupted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette. Northern blot analysis of total hepatic and renal RNA showed that transcript levels are reduced by approximately 50% in heterozygous mice. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the neo tran sgene was not excised via an altered splicing pattern.	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182406	Ncam1<tm1Mag>	A neomycin resistance cassette driven by beta-actin replaced exon 18, which is specific to the 180 kDa isoform of the protein. Immunoblot analysis of brain tissues from homozygous mutant mice did not detect the 180 kDa isoform in neonatal and adult tissue s, and detected the 140kDa isoform in neonatal tissues, but not in adult tissues.                                                                                                                                                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182407	Ncam1<tm2Mag>	Insertion of a PGK-neomycin resistance cassette replaced 500 bp of sequence including exon 13. Exon 13 is a nonalternatively spliced exon that encodes part of the second fibronectin type III repeat in the extracellular domain. The authors predict that thi s allele would produce a truncated product.

MGI:2182566	Prkr<tm1Cwe>	A 2.0kb region, containing portions of exons 2 and 3, was deleted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette adjoined to the 5' end of an upstream mouse sequence (UMS) element. Northern blot analyses, using  various probes, showed that transcriptio n was not terminated by the UMS element. RT-PCR and sequence analysis showed that exons 2 and 3 and the intervening neo cassette had been spliced out in the majority of transcripts. The exon-skipped transcript was shown to be capable of producing protein  in a cell-free system, however, protein was undetected via Western blot analysis of lysates obtained from homozygous mutant mice. Additionally, assays of MEF cell extracts showed an absence of autophosphorylation activity in homozygous mutant mice.       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182570	Tcfap2c<tm1Will>	A 300 bp region of the gene, including the 5' portion of exon 7 encoding the DNA binding domain, was replaced with a PGK-neo cassette via homologous recombination.

MGI:2182575	Dsp<tm2Efu>	A neomycin selection cassette replaced sequence encoding amino acids 281 through 474. The absence of transcript in homozygous mice was verified by Northern blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody targeted to the amino terminal shows  that neither normal or truncated protein was produced from the targeted allele.                                                                                                                                                                                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182576	Gli3<tm1Urt>	The gene was disrupted by targeting of a PGK-neo cassette to exon 1 via homologous recombination. RT-PCR analysis and sequencing of the product revealed a mutant transcript with abnormal splicing at the 3' end of the thymidine kinase negative selection ma rker resulting in a frameshift and premature translation termination of Gli3. The mutant protein truncates at amino acid 699 C-terminal to the zinc-finger domain with 21 additional mutant amino acids before the stop codon, similar to the mutation found in  human Pallister-Hall syndrome.

MGI:2182743	Nfatc2<tm1Rao>	An amino terminal exon, encoding residues conserved in DNA-binding domains, was disrutped by the insertion of a PGK-neo cassette. RT-PCR analysis indicated aberrant splicing in which the targeted exon had been excised, resulting in a frameshift mutation t hat introduced a nonsense mutation at amino acid 438. Protein encoded by the mutant transcript was undetected by several antibodies in extracts from homozygous mutant mice. A DNA-binding assay showed reduced activity in cytosolic extracts of homozygous mu tant T cells (the residual activity was attributed to the presence of protein encoded by Nfatc1).

MGI:2182832	Per2<tm1Drw>	Exon 5 and a portion of exon 6 were replaced by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette. Several transcript forms produced from the targeted allele were identified in homozygous mutant mice via RT-PCR and RACE analyses of brain RNA. The different t ranscripts involved aberrant splicing of exon 4 to a pseudoexon in intron 4, to a cryptic splice site within neo, and to exon 7. In spite of the transcripts having in-frame regions, normal protein was undetected in by immunohistochemical staining of super chiasmatic nuclei over a 24 hour period.

MGI:2182833	Podxl<tm1Kmn>	The majority of exons 5-8 were replaced with a neomycin resistance gene in the opposite orientation via homologous recombination. The gene targeting event deletes 55 amino acids in the extracellular/juxtamembrane region, the transmembrane region, and the  entire cytoplasmic tail. Exons 5, 7, and 8 encode highly conserved domains across species. Absence of gene expression was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis of E16 fetal lung using a 5' region of the gene as a probe. Lack of gene expression was furthe r verified by cell surface immunofluorescence analysis of E15 fetal liver cells using a monoclonal antibody to the mouse protein.

MGI:2182834	Per1<tm1Brd>	A 5.3kb region, encompassing exons 4 through 18, was deleted by the insertion of an Hprt minigene. The vector was designed such that the excision of the inserted cassette and potential subsequent splicing of exon 3 to exon 19 would introduce a frameshift  mutation. Such a transcript was not found, however, a fusion transcript consisting of the first three exons of the endogenous gene aberrantly spliced to exons 3 through 9 of the Hprt transgene was identified by RT-PCR and sequence analysis. Because exons  1 through 3 encode a putatively non-functional region of the protein, the exon was believed to be null.                                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182840	Pkd1<tm2Jzh>	The gene was disrupted by insertion of a PGK-neo cassette into exon 4 via homologous recombination. RT-PCR analysis of homozygous mutants detected a mutant transcript, and sequencing of the product revealed splicing of part of the PGK-neo cassette into th e message resulting in a stop codon 30 bp downstream of exon 3. Northern blot analysis of E13.5 homozygous mutant embryos using cDNA probes to the 5' and 3' regions of the gene revealed a transcript similar in size to the wild type transcript. Western blo t analysis using a monoclonal antibody directed to the N-terminal region of the protein showed that no protein product was made from the mutant transcript.                                                                                                    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182844	Ezh2<tm1Jnw>	Exons 5 and 6 were disrupted by the insertion of a cassette containing lacZ and neo, preventing the transcription of sequence encoding domain II and the carboxy terminal SET domain. Transcript was undetected in homozygous mutant embryos via in situ hybrid ization. Expression of the lacZ transgene was undetected.                                                                                                                                                                                                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182854	Acsl4<tm1Tty>	A neomycin selection cassette was inserted into exon 2, which is the first coding exon. Immunoblotting of hemizygous mutant ES cells showed an absence of protein.                                                                                             	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182862	Hip1<tm1Tsr>	A 13.7 kb region spanning from exon 2 to exon 7 was replaced with a loxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette via homologous recombination. Absence of gene expression was verified in brain and testicular extracts of homozygous mutant animals by Western bl ot analysis using a monoclonal antibody directed against a portion of the protein deleted by the gene targeting event.                                                                                                                                         	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182878	Adcyap1<tm1Aba>	The gene was disrupted by replacement of the 5' portion of exon 5 with a PGK-neo cassette via homologous recombination. RT-PCR analysis using primers to exons 3-4 and exons 3-5 did not detect gene expression in the midbrain and diencephalons of homozygous  mutant animals. In situ hybridization of parasagittal brain sections from homozygous mutants using a probe to the deleted portion of the gene did not detect gene expression. The null allele was further demonstrated by radioimmunoassay (RIA) of brain samp les from homozygous mutant animals, which did not detect protein product.

MGI:2182924	Cnr1<tm1.1Ltz>	This allele was generated by breeding mice heterozygous for Cnr1<tm1Ltz> with transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing cre recombinase. Southern blot analysis showed that the entire open reading frame was removed, leaving a single loxP site and the FLP-rec ombinase target (FRT) flanked neo transgene in the single exon at this locus. A lack of transcript was determined via in situ hybridization of homozygous mutant embyros.                                                                                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182931	Slc18a2<tm1Kmo>	Exons 1 and 2 and flanking intronic sequences were replaced with a neomycin resistance cassette via homologous recombination. Absence of gene expression in homozygous mutant neonates was demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis of total midbrain RNA using primers  to exons 2 and 12.

MGI:2182936	Slc18a2<tm2Kmo>	As a result of incorrect gene targeting, a neomycin resistance cassette inserted between exons 2 and 3 via homologous recombination. A decrease in gene expression in homozygous mutants was observed by RT-PCR analysis of total midbrain RNA using primers to  exons 2 and 12. Western blot analysis of striatal membrane extracts from homozygous mutants showed greater than 95% decrease in protein expression compared to wild type.                                                                                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182939	Mtf1<tm1Wsc>	The insertion of a neomycin selection cassette deleted the first two and a portion of the third zinc-finger domain. RT-PCR analysis of RNA from mutant embryos revealed the presence of an amino-terminal fragment, truncating 39 base pairs downstream of the  5' insertion point. The truncated transcript lacks sequence encoding 3 zinc-finger domains and the acidic, proline-rich, and serine/threonine-rich regions.                                                                                                    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182940	Aire<tm1Pltn>	A neomycin resistance cassette replaced a genomic fragment containing part of exon 6.  This mutation mimics a common human mutation of a termination codon in exon 6.  RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that aberrant trasncripts were expressed, and immunohistoch emisty experiments on sections of thymus liver and brain of homozygous mice confirmed that no detectable protein was made from this allele.                                                                                                                    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182943	Efna2<tm1Jgf>	A neomycin selection cassette, containing stop codons in all three reading frames, was inserted after the sequence encoding amino acid 66. The insertion was upstream of a conserved cysteine residue motif. RT-PCR analysis of midbrain RNA showed an absence  of transcript in homozygous mutant embryos.

MGI:2182947	Slc22a1<tm1Ahs>	Exon 7 encoding putative transmembrane domains 7-9 and flanking intronic sequences were replaced with a PGK-hygro cassette in the reverse orientation via homologous recombination. Northern blot analysis did not detect gene expression in liver or kidney of  homozygous mutant animals. However, RNase protection assay using a probe to nucleotides 447 to 691 lying outside the deleted region detected extremely low levels of transcript, which may represent a truncated and unstable message. Western blot analysis o f homozygous mutant liver and kidney samples using a polyclonal antibody probe recognizing the C-terminal region of rat and mouse protein further verified the absence of gene expression.

MGI:2182950	Elk3<tm1Wlyk>	Exon 2, which encodes the first 69 amino acids (including the initiator methionine), and surrounding intronic sequence were deleted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette. RT-PCR and sequence analysis showed the presence of an aberrantly splice d transcript in which exon 1 had joined exon 3. The aberrant transcript was shown by Western blot analysis to produce a 37kDa protein via an in-frame translational start site at nucleotide 571 (aa 93). The mutant protein lacks the Ets DNA-binding domain. 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2182952	Epx<tm1Nal>	Exons 6-8 were replaced with a PGK-neo cassette via homologous recombination. These exons encode conserved histidine and arginine residues essential to catalytic activity, 6 half-cysteine residues involved in disulfide linkages, and 11 residues located ne ar the heme prosthetic group. RT-PCR analysis verified the absence of gene expression in various tissues from homozygous mutant animals.

Northern blot analyses showed the exclusive presence of truncated transcript containing the neo transgene in homozgous mutan t mice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183313	Mapk8ip<tm1Rjd>	Exon 3, encoding the JNK-binding domain, was deleted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette. Western blot analysis of brain tissue showed an absence of encoded protein in homozygous mutant mice.                                                  	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183316	Ceacam9<tm1Wzm>	All of exon 1 and two-thirds of exon 2 were deleted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette. Neither full-length nor truncated transcripts were detected by Northern blot analysis of total placental RNA obtained from homozygous mutant embyros. Th e absence of transcript was further verified by in situ hybridization.

MGI:2183362	Ktn1<tm1.2Kpf>	This allele was generated by breeding mice carrying Ktn1<tm1Kpf> with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase in early development. Sequence intervening the floxed neomycin selection cassette inserted into intron 2  and the loxP site in intron 5 (exons  3 through 5) was excised. An aberrant transcript in which exon 2 splices to exon 6 and causes a frameshift mutation that introduces a stop codon was identified via RT-PCR and sequence analysis. Transcript was undetected by Northern blot analysis, putativ ely due to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of protein in homozygous mutant mice.                                                                                                                                    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183366	Tpst1<tm1Klm>	Exon 3, the first coding exon, was deleted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette. A truncated transcript was detected in RNA derived from the testes and spleens of mutant mice. This transcript was undetected using a probe for exon 3, indicatin g that sequence encoding the 5' and 3' phosphate-binding domains was absent, thus translation would not result in a functional protein.                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183368	Rbp3<tm1Gil>	Approximately 4.4kb of sequence were deleted by the insertion of a PGK-neo selection cassette. The deleted region contained the promoter and all but 24 base pairs of exon 1. While transcript was undetected by RT-PCR analysis in homozygous mutant mice, Nor thern blot analysis of total retinal RNA showed the presence of a truncated transcript containing the PGK-neo transgene and the untargeted exons. Immunocytochemistry showed the absence of protein in homozygous mutant mice. Western blot analysis confirmed  the staining results as well as verified the lack of protein produced from the truncated transcript.                                                                                                                                                           	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183374	Plcb4<tm1Dwu>	The exon encoding the X box was disrupted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183391	Ptcra<tm1Bal>	320 base pairs of exonic sequence were deleted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette.                                                                                                                                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183393	Pspn<tm1Bjh>	The gene was disrupted by replacement of exon 2 with a PGK-neo cassette via homologous recombination. Homozygous mutant animals were identified by PCR genotype analysis.                                                                                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183400	Vdr<tm1Rge>	Exon 2 and part of intron 2 were replaced with a lacZ-PGK-neo cassette via homologous recombination. Unexpectedly, Northern blot analysis of homozygous mutant animals detected a transcript similar to wild type transcript. RT-PCR and sequence analysis reve aled the mutant transcript was deleted for exon 2 and is expressed in all tissues examined. A second start codon in exon 3 predicts a mutant protein lacking the first zinc finger (amino acids 1-51). Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed  the presence of mutant protein in homozygous animals. Competitive binding assays demonstrated the vitamin D-binding ability of the mutant protein. However, the mutant protein lacks DNA-binding activity as shown by gel mobility shift assay.                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183401	Itga2<tm1Ztr>	Exon 1 was flanked by an upstream floxed neo cassette and a loxP site inserted into intron 1. Transient transfection of ES cells with cre recombinase expression plasmids resulted in the excision of the neo cassette and exon 1. Flow cytometric analysis of  platelets obtained from homozygous mutant mice showed an absence of surface expression. Western blot analysis of protein lysates from platelets and mammary glands confirmed the lack of protien. Neither full-length nor truncated transcript was detected by  RT-PCR analysis of mammary gland lysates.

MGI:2183404	Vdr<tm1Mbd>	A 5 kb region of the gene encompassing exon 3 was replaced with a PGK-neo cassette via homologous recombination resulting in deletion of the second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain. RT-PCR analysis of intestines and kidneys from homozygous mutant ani mals detected a mutant transcript. Sequence analysis revealed a 131 bp deletion corresponding to the second zinc finger and results in a frameshift and nonsense codon 12 bp downstream.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183460	Dad1<tm1Wnt>	The Dad1 locus was disrupted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette that replaced exon 3 of Dad1 and the Tcra associated DNAse I hypersensitive sites 2 through 6. Neither Dad1 transcript nor protein was detected in homozygous mutant mice by RNA se protection or Western blot analyses. Expression analysis showed the deleted hypersensitive sites were necessary for the enhancement of Tcra transcription in a fraction of immature T cells.   	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183467	Nthl1<tm1Yas>	Exons 3 and 4, encoding the conserved helix-hairpin-helix domain, were deleted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette. The absence of full-length transcript was verifed via RT-PCR analysis. The expression of the adjacent Tsc2 was unaffected. Se quence analysis revealed that should an aberrantly spliced transcript arise via readthrough of the neo transgene, the splicing of exon 2 to exon 5 would generate a frameshift mutation that precludes production of a functional protein.                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2183473	Fancg<tm1Faw>	The insertion of a neomycin selection cassette deleted exons 1 through 4.

MGI:2183491	Mbd4<tm1Bird>	A cassette, containing a splice acceptor site and IRES-Beta-geo, was inserted into intron 1 of the endogenous locus. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis showed levels of transcript in homozygous mutant mice to be less than 0.1% of those in wild type mice. T wo truncated transcripts were identified; one which truncated at the transgenic polyadenylation signal and another in which a frameshift mutation was introduced by the excision of the IRES-Beta-geo transgenic region (leaving the the splice acceptor site i n between exons 1 and 2).

MGI:2183514	Pthr1<tm3Hmk>	This hypomorphic allele was identified in conjunction with Pthr<tm2Hmk>. Southern blot analyses showed three copies of the targeting vector, containing a floxed exon 1, at the endogenous locus. Levels of transcript were determined to be reduced in homozyg ous mutant mice via in situ hybridization of the growth plate and Northern blot analysis of total renal RNA.

MGI:2183523	Pkd1<tm1Maa>	Part of exon 43, exon 44, and part of exon 45 were replaced with a neomycin resistance cassette in the reverse orientation via homologous recombination. The gene targeting event introduces a stop codon into exon 43. The mutant allele was confirmed in hete rozygous and homozygous animals by Northern blot analysis.

Expression of cre resulted in the excision of exons 4 and 5 as well as the floxed neomyci n cassette. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses identified a truncated transcript. Sequence analysis showed that the deletion intoduced a frameshift mutation via the splicing of exons 3 and 6. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of a shortened pept ide, putatively lacking several functional domains, including the A and T boxes, the ligand-binding domain, and the activation function 2 domain.

MGI:2183782	Lamc1<tm1Umr>	The genomic region encoding domain III, which contains the nidogen-binding molecule gamma1III4, was deleted and a floxed HSV-TK-neo cassette inserted into the downstream intron via homologous recombination. The HSV-TK-neo cassette was removed by transient  expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted cells. RT-PCR analysis verified the mutant allele in homozygous mutant ES cells. The deletion of gamma1III4 did not appear to interfere with the correct splicing of gamma1III3 to gamma1III5. Ablation of  nidogen-binding activity was confirmed in homozygous mutant embryoid bodies via heparin affinity chromatography and rotary shadow electron microscopy.

MGI:2183787	Kif3c<tm1Gsn>	Two loxP sites were introduced to the intron and 5' untranslated region flanking exon 1, and a third loxP site was introduced with a PGK-TK/PGK-neo cassette directly downstream exon 1 via homologous recombination. Exon 1 and the PGK-TK/PGK-neo cassette we re removed by transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells resulting in the deletion of 2.1 kb of DNA encoding amino acids 1-518 which include the whole motor region and half of the alpha-helical coiled coil domains. Northern blo t analysis detected a truncated transcript encoding the tail end of the gene in homozygous mutant animals. Truncated protein product was detected in homozygous mutants by Western blot analysis using antibodies recognizing the tail end of the protein. Immu noprecipitation of brain lysates from homozygous mutants demonstrated the ability of the truncated protein to specifically bind Kif3a and not Kif3b.

Western blot analysis of blood plasma showed the absence of the gamma polypeptide, preventing the formation of the fibrinogen heterodimer in homozygous mutan t mice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384038	Snrpn<tm1Alb>	A 0.9 kb region of the gene encompassing exon 1 was replaced with a floxed tk-neo cassette via homologous recombination. The tk-neo cassette was removed by transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells. Mutant animals were identif ied by Southern blot analysis. Northern blot analysis showed significantly reduced gene expression in animals carrying the mutation on a paternally derived chromosome, but not when the animals carried the mutation on a maternally derived chromosome.

MGI:2384039	Snrpn<tm2Alb>	A 4.8 kb region of the gene encompassing exon 1 was replaced with a floxed tk-neo cassette via homologous recombination. The tk-neo cassette was removed by transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells. Mutant animals were identif ied by Southern blot analysis. Northern blot analysis using a probe complementary to downstream exons showed significantly reduced gene expression in animals carrying the mutation on a paternally derived chromosome, but not when the animals carried the mu tation on a maternally derived chromosome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384040	Fgr<tm1Hev>	Exon 2 was disrupted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette. While Northern blot analysis of LPS activated macrophages showed the absence of normal and truncated transcripts, elongated transcript containing the neo transgene was detected in hom ozygous mutant mice. Normal protein was undetected by Western blot analysis, and though the absence of truncated carboxy terminal peptide was not directly confirmed, assays of bone marrow derived macrophages verified a lack of protein kinase activity.    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384041	Fgr<tm2Hev>	The insertion of a neomycin selection cassette replaced exon 4 and precluded the complete translation of proteins initiated from a potential start codon at position 59 in the 3' terminal of exon 2. Normal protein was undetected by Western blot analysis of  homozygous mutant mice, however, the lack of truncated carboxy terminal peptides was not directly verified.                                                                                                                                                   	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384045	Snrpn<tm3Alb>	A 6 kb region of the gene encompassing exon 2 was replaced with an HPRT-loxP-neo cassette via homologous recombination resulting in deletion of 32 amino acids from the smaller of 2 open reading frames. The larger downstream open reading frame remains inta ct. RT-PCR analysis of heterozygous mutant animals showed expression of only wild type transcripts in mice carrying a maternally derived mutation, and in mice carrying a paternally derived mutation the mutant transcript and transcripts of the neo gene are  expressed. The deletion does not affect maternal-paternal imprinting of the DNA.                                                                                                                                                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384048	Ube3a <tm2Alb>	Exon 2 of the gene was replaced with a Puro-loxP-HPRT cassette via homologous recombination in ES cells carrying an upstream targeted mutation Snrpn<tm3Alb>. Deletion of genomic DNA from the loxP site within Snrpn to the loxP site within Ube3a was carried  out by transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells. Homozygous mutant embryos were identified by Southern blot analysis.                                                                                                           	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384049	Hck<tm1Hev>	This dicistronic locus was disrupted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette downstream of both start codons. Elongated transcript, containing the neo transgene, and a shortened transcript, resulting from the splicing of exons 1 and 3, were dete cted in homozygous mutant mice by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses.  Normal protein was undetected by Western blot analysis of bone marrow, and though the absence of truncated carboxy terminal peptide was not directly confirmed, assays of immunoprecipita tes verified a lack of protein kinase activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384051	Flt3<tm1Irl>	Exon 3 was disrupted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette at the codon corresponding to residue 59 in the mature protein. An RNAse protection assay detected low levels of transcript in homozygous mutant mice. RT-PCR and sequence analyses of t he mutant transcript showed that the targeted exon 3 had been excised, resulting in a frameshift mutation that introduces a stop codon after codon 51.                                                                                                         	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384054	Pafah1b1<tm1Awb>	Part of exon 6 and all of exon 7 were replaced with a PGK-neo cassette in the opposite orientation via homologous recombination. The targeted mutation results in deletion of amino acids 164-214 and introduces multiple stop codons into exon 6. Homozygous m utant embryos were observed between E5.5 and E7.5 via Southern blot analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                  	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384063	Pafah1b1<tm2.2Awb>	The mutation is derived from Pafah1b1<tm2Awb> by mating to a cre expressing transgenic line to remove the PGK-neo cassette and genomic regions between intron 2 and intron 6 loxP sites. The deletion eliminates exons 3-6 encoding amino acids 11-189. Homozyg ous mutant embryos were observed between E5.5 and E7.5 via Southern blot analysis.                                                                                                                                                                             	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384067	Cp<tm1Samd>	A 3 kb region of the gene including exon 1 and the translation initiation site was replaced with a neomycin resistance cassette via homologous recombination. Southern blot analysis confirmed correct targeting of the allele and Western blot of plasma confi rmed the absence of gene expression in homozygous mutant animals.                                                                                                                                                                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384068	Tfpi<tm1Gjb>	A region containing a portion of exon 4, encoding the first Kunitz domain, and intron 4 was deleted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette. A truncated peptide, putatively translated from an aberrantly spliced transcript lacking sequence encodi ng the Kunitz domain, was detected in heterozygotes by Western blot analysis. Densitometric analysis of the blot showed the level of mutant protein in heterozygotes to be approximately 41% of the level of normal protein in wild type mice. Functional activ ity was found to be reduced by approximately 46% in heterozygous mutant mice and 100% in homozygotes.                                                                                                                                                          	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384073	Lor<tm1Der>	The entire coding region of the endogenous locus was replaced with a neomycin selection cassette.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384075	Gckr<tm1Bms>	Exons 1 and 2 were replaced with a neomycin cassette inserted by homologous recombination. Neither transcript nor protein was detected by Northern or Western blot analyses of liver tissue obtained from homozygous mutant mice.                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384078	Syk<tm1Tyb>	The insertion of a neomycin selection cassette disrupted the exon encoding the subdomain I of the kinase domain. The absence of protein in mice homozygous for the allele was verified by Western blot analysis.                                               	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384080	Cntnap1<tm1Bhat>	Regulatory sequences and the first 7 exons of the gene were replaced with a neomycin resistance cassette via homologous recombination. Loss of gene expression in homozygous mutants was demonstrated by Western blot analysis of whole brain and sciatic nerve  homogenates and by immunohistochemistry of sciatic nerves and CNS. The gene targeting event also disrupts a neighboring gene, Gpr2. This gene is expressed in the small intestine, colon, and Peyer's patches and Gpr2 homozygous mutants are fertile and show  no phenotype. Authors conclude the concomitant deletion of Gpr2 has no effect on the neurologic phenotype of Cntnap1 mutant mice.                                                                                                                             	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384082	Cntn1<tm1Brns>	The gene was disrupted by insertion of a PGK-neo cassette into exon 3 via homologous recombination. Absence of protein product in homozygous mutant animals was verified by Western blot analysis of brain homogenates and immunohistochemical analysis of cere bellum sections. Additionally, cerebellar granule cells cultured from homozygous mutants did not immunoprecipitate or stain for protein product.

MGI:2384084	Ugt8<tm1Wst>	The gene was disrupted by insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette into exon 1 via homologous recombination. In situ hybridization of brain sections using an antisense RNA probe to the gene verified the absence of gene expression in homozygous mutant a nimals. Galactosyl transferase assays of brain samples from homozygous mutant animals did not detect enzymatic activity.                                                                                                                                       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384086	Foxb1<tm1Pgr>	Portions of exons 1 and 2 were replaced with a neomycin selection cassette. The deleted region included the translational start site and the fork head domain.                                                                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2384087	Fshr<tm1Saco>	The insertion of a neomycin selection cassette deleted exon 1. Northern blot analysis of testicular and ovarian RNA showed that the deletion was sufficient for abbrogating the expression of all known isoforms. The absence of functional protein in homozygo us mutant mice was confirmed by lableled ligand binding assays of testis.

MGI:2384120	Cd3e<tm1Lov>	A 3' portion of exon 5 and all of exon 6, encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains, were deleted by the insertion of a floxed neo cassette. Northern blot analysis of total RNA obtained from thymocytes showed an absence of Cd3e transcript and r educed levels of Cd3d and Cd3g transcript in homozygous mutant mice. The downregulation of the delta and gamma polypeptides was believed to be due to the reverse transcriptional orientation of the neo transgene having an effect on the enhancer for Cd3d an d Cd3g. To eliminate this effect, Cd3e<tm1.1Lov> was generated by breeding mice possesing this allele with cre expressing mice.

MGI:2384123	Cd3e<tm1.1Lov>	This allele was generated by breeding mice homozygous for Cd3e<tm1Lov> with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase via the EIIa promoter, resulting in the excision of the floxed neo. Northern blot analysis of homozygous mutant mice showed normal level s of Cd3d and Cd3g transcript as well as the presence of a truncated Cd3e transcript. Sequencing of Cd3e cDNA derived from RT-PCR analysis showed the splicing of exons 4 to 7 (lacking the extracellular and transmembrane domains). Western blot analysis sho wed the absence of truncated protein product.

MGI:2385926	Nfe2l2<tm1Ywk>	A 4.2 kb segment was replaced by an in-frame lacZ gene followed by a neomycin selection cassette.  Northern blot analysis on RNA derived from various tissues confirmed that a fusion transcript was detectable in intestine of homozygous mice, but no wild-ty pe transcript was detectable in any tissue.  However, no fusion protein was detected by histochemical staining in any adult tissue.                                                                                                                            	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2385928	Rxrg<tm1Ipc>	The insertion of a neomycin selection cassette deleted exons 3 and 4, which encode the DNA binding domain and are common to both isoforms generated from this locus. While normal transcript was undetected several types of aberrant transcript were detected  in homozygous mutant mice by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses, including 1.6 and 3.0 kb fragments derived from the exon 1b isoform and several others derived from the exon 1a isoform. The 1.6 kb fragment involves an aberrant splice between exon 1b and ex on 5, resulting in an isolated ligand binding coding region. The 3.0 kb fragment is believed to be the result of cryptic splicing within the neo transgene or an intron. All of the aberrant transcripts lacked the DNA binding domain.

MGI:2386283	Adcyap1r1<tm1Aba>	The insertion of a neomycin selection cassette disrupted exon 2, which encodes the 5' untranslated region, the start codon, and the majority of the signal peptide. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses identified an aberrant transcript in which exon 1 had spl iced to exon 3. In vitro studies of the protein generated from a start codon in exon 3 of this transcript showed improper localization and post-translational processing. Specifically, cell surface expression of the mutant protein was reduced and it was la rgely unglycosylated.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2386324	Ikbkg<tm1Mpa>	Flanking loxP sites were introduced to exon 2 and an FRT-flanked neomycin resistance cassette was inserted into the downstream intron via homologous recombination. Deletion of exon 2 and the neo cassette was carried out by transient expression of cre and  flp recombinases in correctly targeted ES cells. Western blot analysis of mouse embyonic fibroblasts cultured from E12.5 homozygous mutant embryos confirmed the null allele. It was also shown that the targeted mutation did not interfere with neighboring g ene G6pdx.

MGI:2386327	Igf1r<tm1Mhz>	Exon 3 was flanked by a floxed neo cassette inserted into intron 2 and a single loxP site in intron 3. Several aberrant transcripts involving the splicing of exon 2 to cryptic slice sites in the neo transgene were identified by RT-PCR and sequence analyse s. Further analysis indicated that the readthrough of the neo transgene will result in functional ablation due to truncation or the inclusion of a random neo fragment. Mice carrying this allele were crossed with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase  via the EIIa promoter to generate Igf1r<tm1.1Mhz> and Igf1r<tm1.2Mhz>.                                                                                                                                                                                         	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2386329	Igf1r<tm1.2Mhz>	The in vivo expression of cre recombinase via the EIIa promoter resulted in the excision of a floxed fragment containing a neo cassette and exon 3 from Igf1r<tm1Mhz>.

MGI:2386330	Slc18a2<tm1Mca>	The sequences encoding transmembrane domains 3 and 4 were deleted and replaced with a PGK-neo cassette via homologous recombination. Absence of gene expression in homozygous mutant animals was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis and Western blot of whole brain R NA and synatpic vesicles from newborn animals. Binding assays using proteins prepared from synaptic vesicles showed no binding activity in the homozygous mutants.                                                                                             	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2386331	Kcna4<tm1Lndn>	The gene was disrupted by replacement of a large part of the coding region with a PGK-neo cassette resulting in the deletion of the N-terminal multimerization domain. Northern blot analysis of brain RNA from homozygous mutant animals detected a truncated  transcript, and Western blot analysis failed to detect the 85 kDa protein in the heart or brain. However, a 65 kDa protein was detected that may possibly be another channel protein that cross-reacts with the anti-Kcna4 antibody.

MGI:2386397	Renbp<tm1Csch>	The gene was disrupted by replacement of a 1 kb region including part of exon 5 and exon 6 with a neomycin resistance cassette via homologous recombination. The targeted mutation results in deletion of sequences encoding a leucine zipper motif, which is r equired for interaction with renin. Homozygous mutant animals did not express gene transcripts as determined by Northern blot analysis of kidney RNA.

Deletion of the B1 insert in mutant animals was confirmed by RNA analysis of neural ti ssues. Northern blot of various tissues from homozygous animals showed a significant decrease in gene expression. Protein expression was also significantly decreased in both embryonic and adult homozygous mutants as shown by Western blot analysis.        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2386445	Myhn2<tm2Rsad>	The gene was disrupted by insertion of a PGK-neo cassette into exon 2 just downstream of the translation initiation codon via homologous recombination. Northern blot analysis of brain RNA from mutant animals detected a 0.9 kb mutant transcript containing  the PGK-neo insertion. Western blot analysis of several tissues from newborn homozygous mutant animals showed an absence of protein product.

MGI:2386983	Col13a1<tm1Pih>	Exon 1, which encodes 96 residues that make up the cytosolic and transmembrane domains as well as a portion of the ectodomain, was deleted by in vitro cre mediated recombination. An aberrant trasncript resulting from a cryptic splice site within intron 1  was detected by RT-PCR. Sequence analysis identified two start codons in intron 1 that are in frame with exon 2. Translation of the aberrant transcript is expected to produce a protein in which the 96 endogenous amino acids are replaced with either 65 or  11 residues encoded by intronic sequence. The novel amino terminal is expected to lack the transmembrane and signal peptide characteristics of the endogenous protein.

MGI:2387818	Tsix<tm2Jtl>	The insertion of a floxed neo cassette deleted 3.7 kb of sequence encompassing a CpG island, transcriptional start sites, and the putative promoter. Expression analysis showed a significant reduction in, if not a complete ablation of, transcription from t he targeted allele, though transcript was shown to be produced from the normal X on the untargeted chromosome. Residual transcription was only detected by increased PCR cycles, though it was not clear if this weak transcription was due to minor and/or cry ptic promoters or rather to overcylcing conditions. No residual transcription was detected by RNA FISH.

MGI:2387965	Eif2ak4<tm1Drc>	The majority of exon 12, which encodes the kinase subdomains 2 through 4 common to the 3 known isoforms (alpha, beta, and gamma), was replaced by a neomycin selection cassette inserted by homologous recombination. While, RT-PCR analysis showed the presenc e of an aberrant splice product, sequence analysis showed it generated a frameshift mutation in the open reading frame. Western blot analysis verified the absence of protein.                                                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2387971	Ptger1<tm1Jdm>	671 bp of coding sequence were replaced by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette into exon 2. Transcript was undetected in liver, uterus, and kidney tissue by RT-PCR analysis and in situ hybridization of kidney tissue. Western blot analysis of Pr kcl1 protein expression indicated that the targeting vector did not significantly disrupt the the Prkcl1 locus, which putatively overlaps the Ptger1 locus.

MGI:2387973	Mcsp<tm1Wen>	Exon 2 was replaced by a neomycin selection cassette inserted by homologous recombination. Normal transcript was undetected in homozygous mutant mice by Northern blot analysis of testicular RNA. Western blot analysis showed that only the neomycin protein,  and not the normal protein, was produced from the disrupted allele.                                                                                                                                                                                           	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2387975	Ksr<tm1Shaw>	The exon encoding the CA2 domain was replaced by a neomycin selection cassette inserted by homologous recombination. While RT-PCR demonstrated that the neo cassette could be excised, Western blot analysis using both amino and carboxy terminal antibodies s howed an absence of both normal truncated protein.

MGI:2387988	Smarca2<tm1Mya>	The majority of the exon encoding amino acids 120-176 was replaced with a neomycin resistance cassette via homologous recombination. RT-PCR analysis of liver RNA from homozygous mutant animals revealed a faint truncated transcript resulting from an altern ative splice product which skips the disrupted exon. Western blot analysis of brain nuclear extracts detected a shortened protein product expressed at less than 1% the amount of wild type protein. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the mutant  protein lacked functional capabilities.

MGI:2388007	Acdc<tm1Chan>	Exon 2 was replaced by a floxed neo cassette inserted by homologous recombination. Transcript was undetected in adipose tissue by Northern blot analysis of homozygous mutant mice. The lack of immunoreactivity by Western blot analysis using a carboxy termi nal antibody indicated an absence of normal and truncated protein.                                                                                                                                                                                             	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2388018	Ambp<tm1Kkm>	A neo-derived cassette was introduced into exon 7 and the downstream intron via homologous recombination. The neo cassette introduces translation termination codons before serine 7 of the bikunin protein. The alpha 1 microglobulin sequence, which is trans lated as a fusion protein with bikunin, remains unchanged.

MGI:2388023	Numb<tm1.1Lso>	Exon 1 was deleted by crossing animals carrying mutant allele Numb<tm1Lso> to the cre deleter line TgN(EIIa-cre)C5379Lmgd. Homozygous mutant embryos were observed up to day E10.5. RT-PCR analysis detected a mutant transcript lacking exon 1, and Western bl ot analysis detected a 65 kDa protein product presumably translated from methionine 55 of the mutant transcript. The truncated protein would not be functional since it lacks the arginine at position 53 required for binding activity.                       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2388024	Ddr1<tm1Wfv>	Exon 1-12 were deleted and replaced with a neomycin resistance gene via homologous recombination.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2388026	Raf1<tm1Bacc>	Exon 3 was flanked with loxP sites by insertion of a floxed TK-neo cassette and a single loxP site into the upstream and downstream introns, respectively. Exon 3 was removed by transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells. Absenc e of gene expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from homozygous mutant embryos. Immune complex kinase assays showed a lack of enzyme activity in MEFs from homozygous mutants.                       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2388036	Dlgh2<tm1Dsb>	The exon encoding the second PDZ domain was replaced with a TK-neo cassette via homologous recombination. Northern blot analysis of brain RNA from homozygous mutant animals detected a faint mutant transcript of higher mobility, presumably an alternative s plice product that skips the deleted exon. However, Western blot analysis of brain proteins using antibodies directed against a region N-terminal to the deleted exon did not detect protein product.                                                          	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2388038	Blm<tm1Grdn>	Exons 10, 11, and 12 were replaced by an hprt cassette inserted by homologous recombination. The deletion was designed to recapitulate the BLM<Ash> allele, which is carried by approximately 1% of Ashkenazi Jews and contains a frameshift mutation in exon 1 0 that results in the premature truncation of the encoded protein. Western blot analysis of lysates from heterzygous testes tissue showed reduced levels of normal protein and an absence of truncated protein. No protein was detected in lysates from homozyg ous mutant embryos.

MGI:2429675	Cabin1<tm1.1Che>	The floxed neomycin selection cassette that had replaced the last two exons of the endogenous gene was excised from Cabin1<tm1Che> via in vivo cre mediated recombination. The deleted region encoded the carboxy terminal which includes the calcineurin, calm odulin, and MEF2 binding domains. Northern blot analysis of homozygous mutant mice identified a transcript of the anticipated size in brain and thymus tissue. While RT-PCR and subsequent sequence analysis showed that translation of this transcript could r esult in a truncated protein that contained 4 new amino acid residues in place of the endogenous carboxy terminal, the lack of an amino terminal antibody prevented direct confirmation of such a peptide.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2445458	Polk<tm1.1Esp>	This allele is a derivative of Polk<tm1Esp>. The loxP-flanked exon 6 and downstream neo cassette were removed by crossing Polk<tm1Esp> animals to a cre deleter strain resulting in the deletion of essential catalytic residues apartate 197 and glutamate 198 , as well as a frameshift mutation via splicing from exon 5 to exon 7. RT-PCR analysis of testis RNA confirmed the presence of a shorter transcript in mutant animals. Northern blot analysis showed that the mutant transcript is expressed at 5 times less th an the wild type allele.

MGI:2445460	Xist<tm2.1Jae>	Exons 1, 2, and 3 as well as 5 kb of the proximal promoter were deleted via cre mediated recombination of single loxP sites in the 5' untranslated region and intron 3. Though complete transcriptional ablation was previously reported by Csankocszki et al.,  1999 (J:75502), Turner et al., 2002 (J:80117) reported an endogenous testis-specific transcript that utilizes an upstream promoter in wild type mice and therefore is putatively present in mutant mice. The deleted region encoded a domain essential for X c hromosome inactivation.

MGI:2445721	Rbp4<tm1Gott>	The endogenous locus was disrupted by the insertion of a neomycin cassette that replaced sequence extending from 252 bp upstream of the TATA box through exon 2. While neither normal transcript or protein was detected by Northern or Western blot analyses o f homozygous mutant mice, an elongated transcript and a 28 kDa protein were observed. Analysis of labeled retinol in serum fractions and in vivo binding experiments indicated that the mutant protein was present in high molecular weight aggregates and did  not function to transport retinol in circulation.

MGI:2447173	Guca2<tm1.1Mcoh>	Excision of the floxed 4.5 kb fragment (-1886 to +2714, numbering based reference J:80886) encompassing exon 3 and portions of introns 2 and 3 was achieved via in vivo cre mediated recombination. Though the endogenous promoter was left intact, truncated t ranscript was undetected by Northern blot analysis. Western blot analysis of ileum and distal colon tissue further indicated a complete disruption of expression.

MGI:2447178	Igh-6<tm1Msn>	A secretory isoform specific mutation was achieved by deleting a 1.8 kb fragment encompassing sequence encoding a portion of the tailpiece and the stop codon and polyadenylation sites. A single loxP site was left in place of the deleted sequence after the  in vitro removal of the floxed tk-neo selection. Serum Igh-6 was undetectable in homozygous mutant mice. Flow cytometric analysis showed increased expression of the surface isoform. Study of heterozygous mice using allotype specific antibodies indicated  that the augmented surface expression was a result of affected RNA processing rather than compensation.

MGI:2447190	Cd36<tm1Frm>	The gene was disrupted by replacement of exons 3-9 with a neomycin resistance cassette via homologous recombination. Absence of gene expression in homozygous mutant animals was verified by Western blot analysis of several organ samples and primary myeloid  cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2447194	Igh<tm1Cog>	A floxed tk-neo cassette was inserted upstream of the E mu enchancer in the intergenic region following the Igh-J region, such that E mu and its flanking matrix-associated regions (MARs) were left intact. Flow cytometric analysis showed a lack of surface  IgM<+> B cells, while ELISA indicated an absence of all serum immunoglobulin classes. The insertion blocked transcription of the Igh-J region and prevented rearranged VDJ segments. Excision of the neo cassette resulted in rescue, indicating the observed p henotypes were the result of the presence of neo rather than a deletion of a regulatory element.

MGI:2447298	Mid1<tm1Hzo>	A 2.0 kb genomic fragment was replaced with a cassette containing a puromycin resistance gene, a loxP site, and exons 3 through 9 of hprt. The deleted region contained a 5' untranslated exon that is orthologous to a human STS at the telomeric end of the h uman microphthalmia with linear skin defects (MLS) critical region. The single loxP site was inserted in this region to later use as a telomeric anchor point for a larger deletion extending from 61b3r through to the rhoGAP domain of Arhgap6, recapitulatin g a deletion associated with human MLS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2447302	Arhgap6<tm1Hzo>	Exons 6, 7, and 8 were deleted by the insertion of a cassette containing a neomycin resistance gene, a single loxP site, and a 5' portion of an hprt minigene. Sequence analysis of RT-PCR products verified the deletion of the targeted exons and the splicin g of exon 5 to exon 9, resulting in frameshift and consequent nonsense mutation. The  transcript encodes a truncated protein containing 2 putative SH3-binding domains. The single loxP site was inserted for use as a centromeric anchor point for a larger de letion extending from the rhoGAP domain of Arhgap6 through a 5' untranslated exon of Mid1, recapitulating a deletion associated with human MLS.

MGI:2447336	Nqo2<tm1Akj>	A 2.1 kb fragment encompassing exon 3 and portions of the surrounding introns was replaced by a neo cassette inserted by homologous recombination. Neither transcript nor protein was detected by Northern or Western blot analyses of liver, kidney, testis, a nd lung tissue obtained from homozygous mutant mice. Assays of benzo(alpha)pyrene-sensitive Nqo2 activity showed levels to be almost completely abrogated in kidney, testes, and lung samples and reduced by approximately 80% in liver samples. The authors re port that the residual activity in the liver is believed to be the result of related proteins.

MGI:2447398	Npy2r<tm1.1Hhz>	This allele is derived from Npy2r<tm1Hhz>. The floxed Npy2r gene was deleted by crossing Npy2r<tm1Hhz> animals to cre deleter strain TgN(CMV-cre)1Cgn. Resulting progeny have a single loxP site in place of the Npy2r sequence.                               	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2447441	Slc9a2<tm1Ges>	The gene was disrupted by insertion of a neomycin resistance gene into exon 2, which encodes transmembrane domains 2-7 (amino acids 99-252). Northern blot analysis detected reduced levels of mutant transcript in kidney, small and large intestines, and hig h levels of mutant transcript in stomach of homozygous mutant animals. Sequence analysis revealed a cryptic splice donor site at codon 172 of exon 2 spliced to the acceptor of site exon 3. This alternative transcript results in a frameshift eliminating 61 4 out of 813 amino acids. The deleted region includes 9 out of 12 putative transmembrane domains and the carboxy terminal hydrophilic domain.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2447529	Rnf2<tm1Hko>	The authors generated a hypomorphic Rnf2 allele using gene targeting.  No genomic sequence was deleted, however a Neo cassette and 0.8 kb of one of the homology arms were inserted between exons 3 and 4.  The inserted sequence was from 3' UTS.  Protein lev els in the homozygous mutant were 30% of those in the heterozygous mutant.

MGI:2447611	Mbd4<tm1Wed>	The gene was disrupted by replacement of exon 3 and part of intron 3 with a PGK-neo cassette via homologous recombination. The targeted mutation results in deletion of the catalytic domain encoded by exon 3. RT-PCR analysis of RNA from homozygous mutant a nimals confirmed deletion of exon 3 and revealed a low level exon2-exon4 alternative splice product. The predicted product contains a frameshift mutation resulting in a nonfunctional 125 amino acid protein, of which 98 amino acids are Mbd4-derived.

While normal protein was undetected by Western blot analysis of homozygous mutant embryo brain lysates, an aberrant protein generated from an int ernal start codon was identified at a level similar to that of the wild type protein. Though sequence encoding the RasGAP binding and RhoGAP domains was retained by the mutant allele, the mutant protein failed to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation or RasGAP  association in the brain. Analysis of heterozygous mice indicated improper localization of the mutant protein. Whereas 34% of the wild type protein was isolated in a detergent-insoluble fraction of brain lysate, only 7% of the mutant protein was present  in the same fraction. In addition, study of MEFs indicated differential subcellular localization.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2669951	Ssrp1<tm1Rul>	Exons 14 to 17 were replaced with a PGK-neomycin cassette which thus deletes the HMG box domain as well as 87 C-terminal amino acids.  Targeted ES cell clones produced only half as much protein as wild-type cells when assessed by Western blot.            	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2669956	Gpam<tm1Rcol>	A 0.5 kb genomic fragment encoding 62 amino acids including those that make up homology regions II and III was replaced with a neo cassette inserted by homologous recombination. Transcript was undetected by Northern blot analysis of homozygous mutant live r tissue. Activity assays indicated a near comlpete ablation of endogenous activity and showed that the activity of the microsomal isoform was unperturbed.

MGI:2670117	Mbl1<tm1.1Mnz>	The floxed neomycin selection cassette that replaced all of exons 2 and 3 and a portion of exon 4 in Mbl1<tm1Mnz> was excised from the germline via cre mediated recombination. Normal transcript was undetected by Northern blot analysis of total RNA obtaine d from thioglycolate-stimulated livers of homozygous mutant mice.                                                                                                                                                                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2670119	Vti1b<tm1Gfvm>	Exon 4, which encodes the SNARE motif, was disrupted by the insertion of a neomycin selection cassette. Neither normal transcript nor normal protein was detected in homozygous mutant mice by Northern and Western blot analyses.                             	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2670134	Wasf2<tm1Tta>	The exon encoding the start codon was replaced with a neo cassette. Protein was undetected by Western blot analysis of homozygous mutant mice.

MGI:2670227	Ssa2<tm1Woln>	Exon 2 was replaced with a neomycin selection cassette inserted by homologous recombination. Normal protein was undetectable by Western blot analysis of homozygous mutant brain extracts.                                                                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2670368	Thra<tm3Jas>	A loxP flanked cassette containing neo and tk genes replaced a 257 bp fragment of intron 7, eliminating a portion of the internal promoter that drives expression of two short isoforms, TRdeltaalpha1 and TRdeltaalpha2. The floxed selection genes were excis ed prior to germline transmission. Whereas wild type levels of transcript encoding the two longer isoforms, TRalpha1 and TRalpha2, were detected in homozygous mutant mice, the levels of transcript encoding the shorter isoforms were reduced.               	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2670461	Gnpat<tm1Just>	Exons 5 through 7 were replaced by a neomycin selection cassette inserted by homologous recombination.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2670480	AA691260<tm1Her>	Exon 4 was replaced with a neomycin selection cassette that was flanked by both loxP and FRT sites. The deletion of exon 4 disrupts sequence encoding the PTB domain. Normal protein was undetected in homozygous mutant mice by Western blot analysis using an  antibody directed against the PTB domain. If aberrant splicing were to occur between exons 3 and 5, a frameshift mutation and resultant nonsense mutation would putatively preclude the translation of the clathrin and adapter protein complex (AP-2) binding  sites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2670511	Rgn<tm1Aish>	Exon III was disrupted by the insertion of a neomycin gene.  The absence of gene product was proven by Western blot analysis of liver extracts from hemizygous males and homozygous females.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2670555	Elf1<tm1Jni>	Exons 2 and 3 were replaced with a neomycin resistance gene in the antisensense orientation. Northern blot analysis indicated a lack of transcript while the absence of protein was confirmed immunologically.                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)

MGI:2670572	Pdgfb<tm3Cbet>	A stop codon was inserted into exon 6 via homologous recombination of a targeting vector which also included a loxP flanked neo cassette in intron 5. The insertion of the stop codon precludes the translation of the retention moftif. Mice carrying this all ele were bred with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase to generate Pdgfb<tm3.1Cbet>.

MGI:2670574	Pdgfb<tm3.1Cbet>	The floxed neo cassette was removed from intron 5 of Pdgfb<tm3Cbet> via in vivo cre mediated recombination. The stop codon that was inserted into exon 6 remained intact and precluded the translation of the retention motif.                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2670598	Hap1<tm1Xjl>	Exons 1 and 2, which encode the first 131 amino acids, were replaced with a neomycin selection cassette.

MGI:2670743	H2afx<tm1Fwa>	Endogenous sequence encompassing the promoter, single exon, and poly A site was floxed and subsequently excised via cre-mediated recombination in ES cells, leaving a single loxP site in place of the endogenous gene.                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2670952	Ptx3<tm1Zuk>	A neomycin selection cassette replaced a genomic fragment containing exons 1 and 2 by homologous recombination.  The deleted region encodes the initiation codon and signal peptide for secretion of the protein, so the mutation is predicted to be a null all ele.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2671049	Igsf1<tm1Zuk>	Exon 1 was replaced with a PGK-HPRT cassette. This deletes the transcription start site used by three isoforms of this gene.  Northern blot analysis indicated that mRNA for these isoforms was not present. mRNA for a fourth isoform which uses a different t ranscription start site was detectable however.  These results were confirmed by RT-PCR.                                                                                                                                                                       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2671068	Tkt<tm1Jpi>	Genomic sequences including intron 2 and exon 3 were replaced by a neomycin selection cassette by homologous recombination.  Western blot analysis demonstrated that various tissues of heterozygous mice expressed half the amount of encoded protein, and enz ymatic assays demonstrated reductions in enzyme activity in various tissues of heterozygous mice.

MGI:2677047	Igf2<tm1Wrk-m>	Sequence encompassing the second placenta-specific exon (U2) and the first differentially methylated region (DMR1), located 3 kb upstream of the first fetal promoter (P1), was replaced by a single loxP site following cre-mediated recombination. Whereas th e maternally transmitted wild type allele is silenced, maternal transmission of the deletion results in biallelic expression. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild type allele which is silenced soon after birth, both maternally and paternally transmitted a lleles were continually transcribed postnatally.

MGI:2677155	Igf2<tm1Wrk-p>	Sequence encompassing the second placenta-specific exon (U2) and the first differentially methylated region (DMR1), located 3 kb upstream of the first fetal promoter (P1), was replaced by a single loxP site following cre-mediated recombination. In contras t to the wild type allele which is silenced soon after birth, both maternally and paternally transmitted alleles were continually transcribed postnatally. In addition to the loss of imprinting, the deletion resulted in the ablation of placenta-specific tr anscript. Transcript was undetected by in situ hybridization of placentae from heterozygous mice carrying a paternally transcribed mutant allele.

MGI:2677157	Air<tm1Dpb-p>	A 1.2 kb rabbit beta-globin fragment containing a polyadenylation cassette was inserted immediately downstream of the 3.7 kb imprint control element (ICE). The insertion was designed to truncate the RNA product to 4% of its length without disrupting the I CE. While the allele maintains its imprinted status and wild type expression levels, the truncation results in a loss of gene silencing of the Igf2r/Slc22a2/Slc22a3 cluster on the paternal chromosome. An aberrant transcript was identified by RT-PCR analys is. This splice varient involved a splice donor 53 bp downstream of the transcription start site that joined a slice acceptor of transgenic beta-globin exon 3.                                                                                                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2677163	Vpreb1<tm1Shim>	The entire gene together with exon 1 of Igl-5 were replaced with a neomycin resistance gene flanked by loxP sites.  Lack of mRNA was demonstrated by PCR.                                                                                                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2677165	Vpreb2<tm1Shim>	The entire gene was replaced with a hygromycin resistance gene and single adjacent loxP site in ES cells in which Vpreb1 and Igl5 had already been disrupted.  Absence of mRNA transcripts was established by PCR.                                             	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2677170	Igl-5<tm1Shim>	Exon 1 of this gene as well as the entire VpreB1 gene were replaced with a neomycin resistance gene flanked by loxP sites.  mRNA transcripts of this gene were not detected by Northern blot analysis but small amounts of a truncated product containing slice d exons 2 and 3 could be detected by PCR.  No protein product was predicted from this mRNA.  All mRNA product could be eliminated by cre mediated excision of the neomycin insert but this had no ultimate effect on the observed phenotypes.                  	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2677305	Ephb1<tm1Cmn>	Exon 3 has been replaced by a neomycin resistance gene which causes a frame shift in addition to the exon loss.  Western blot analysis confirmed the abvsence of protein product.                                                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2677314	Recql4<tm1Abe>	6 bp (2045 to 2050) were replaced with a neomycin selection cassette inserted in exon 13 by homologous recombination. The disrupted exon encodes a RecQ helicase domain and has been identified as being mutated in human patients with Rothmund-Thomson syndro me (RTS). RT-PCR analysis of mutant MEFs identified transcript in which exon 12 had spliced to exon 14. Because the length of exon 13 is a multiple of 3 (180 bp), the aberrant transcript is expected to be in frame. In addition to the transcript lacking ex on 13, which was determined to be present at a level 1% to 2% that of wild type, shorter mutant transcripts comprised of exons 1 through 12 were detected.                                                                                                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2677350	Slc7a9<tm1Nune>	6.1 kb of sequence, encompassing exons 3 through 9, was replaced with a neo cassette. Though wild type transcript was undetected by Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from the kidney cortex and medulla and from the jejunum, an aberrant trancscript in  which exons 2 and 10 had spliced together was identified. This transcript contains frameshifted sequence and lacks sequence encoding the 12 transmembrane domains. Protein was undetected in homozygous mutant mice by Western blot analysis in both reducing a nd non-reducing conditions.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2678314	Top1<tm1Unc>	A neomycin selection cassette replaced a genomic fragment containing exon 15.  Western blot analysis demonstrated that a 45% reduction of encoded protein levels was present in cells derived from heterozygous mice.  Cytological analysis of early homozygous  mutant embryos demonstrated that no detectable protein was produced from this allele.

MGI:2678322	Mnt<tm1.1Phu>	Mice heterozygous for Mnt<tm1Phu> were crossed with transgenic mice carryingTgN(EIIa-cre)C5379Lmgd.  In mice carrying both the transgene and Mnt<tm1Phu>, cre excision removed exons 4 to 6 as well as the Hygro selection cassette.  The predicted protein pro duct would thus lack the C-terminal amino acids from residue 235 to 591. No mRNA transcripts were identified by RT-PCR in embryos homozygous for this disruption.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:2680674	Foxn1<tm1Nrm>	The insertion of sequence encoding GFP into exon 3 resulted in the generation of a hypomorphic allele lacking exon 3. Though the floxed neo cassette used for selection was excised, inverted repeats at the insertion site of the remaining loxP site may be t he reason for the aberrant splicing. Mutant transcript was detected by Northern blot, RT-PCR, and RNase protection. Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products showed that exon 2 spliced directly to exon 4, producing a transcript lacking exon 3 similar to a  splice variant found at low levels in wild type mice. The transcript putatively encodes protein lacking 154 residues from the N-terminal domain, but containing the nuclear localization signal and DNA-binding and C-terminal acidic activation domains.

MGI:2687365	Cd79a<tm2Pld>	Exons 2 and 3 were replaced by a loxP site, an EGFP gene, a cDNA cassette containing exons 2 - 5 in inverse orientation and a floxed neomycin resistance gene.  Lack of mRNA expression was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis.  Although designed to be a  cre dependent conditional allele capable of expressing either EGFP or Ig-alpha, neither of the inserted genes were ever expressed.

MGI:3026700	Efnb3<tm1Henk>	An frt-flanked neo cassette and a loxP-flanked lacZ cassette were inserted at the endogenous locus. The neo cassette was inserted at a restriction site within intron 4 while the lacZ cassette was inserted in frame in exon 5, disrupting codons 264 through  340 which make up the majority of the cytoplasmic domain. Normal protein was undetected in homozygous mutant mice by Northern blot analysis, however a truncated transcript was detected. Thos mutation is expected to ablate both forward and reverse signalin g. The presence of the neo cassette prevented expression of lacZ.

MGI:3026703	Efnb3<tm1.2Henk>	The loxP-flanked lacZ cassette was removed from Efnb2<tm1.1Henk> (frt-flanked neo excised from Efnb2<tm1Henk>) via cre-mediated recombination, generating a stop codon in exon 5. The nonsense mutation precludes the translation of the cytoplasmic tail (beyo nd codon 264). This allele is expected to encode a protein similar to Efnb2<tm1.1Henk>, however lacking beta-gal. Similarly, this mutation is expected to ablate reverse signaling while leaving forward signaling intact.                                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)

MGI:3028827	Mmp24<tm1Ski>	Exon 5 and part of exon 6 were replaced with a MCI-neomycin cassette.  This resulted in the loss of the zinc binding site in the catalytic domain and a frame shift at the exon 4-exon 7 junction.  Northern blot analysis indicated a faint band representing  the mutant transcript which codes only the propeptide and N-terminal part of the catalytic fragment.

MGI:3028843	Hspa1a/Hspa1b<tm1Tkp>	Portions of both Hspa1a and Hspa1b were replaced with a single neomycin selection cassette inserted by homologous recombination. Neither Hspa1a nor Hspa1b transcript was detected by Northern blot analysis of homozygous mutant MEFs (before and after heat s hock). Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of both protein species in homozygous mutant MEFs.                                                                                                                                                           Portions of both Hspa1a and Hspa1b were replaced with a single neomycin selection cassette inserted by homologous recombination. Neither Hspa1a nor Hspa1b transcript was detected by Northern blot analysis of homozygous mutant MEFs (before and after heat s hock). Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of both protein species in homozygous mutant MEFs.

MGI:3028853	Ripk3<tm1Vmd>	A sequence fragment encompassing exons 1 through 3 was replaced with a floxed PGK-neo cassette. Protein was undetected by Western blot analysis of homozygous mutant MEFs, bone marrow-derived macrophages, B and T lymphocytes, and thymocytes.               	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:3028868	Pou2f1<tm1Shrp>	Exon 3 was replaced with a floxed neo cassette. The deleted exon is common to all three known isoforms and does not overlap with Cd3z, a locus that overlaps a distal portion of the Pou2f1 locus. Mutant transcript, in which exon 2 aberrantly splices to exo n 4a, was identified by RT-PCR analysis of homozygous mutant MEFs. The aberrant splicing results in a frameshift mutation which consequently generates a nonsense mutation and precludes the translation of two-thirds of the mature protein including the DNA- binding domain.

MGI:3028906	Tnfsf13<tm1Ash>	A 2.5 kb genomic fragment, encompassing a portion of exon 1 and all of exons 2 through 6, was replaced with a neo cassette. The deletion was designed to eliminate both the secreted and transmembrane porteins produced by the endogenous locus. Tnfsf13 prote in was undetected by FACS analysis of homozygous mutant splenocytes. Real-time RT-PCR indicated that the levels of Tnfsf12 and Senp3 transcript, poduced by loci in close proximity to Tnfsf13, were not affected by the targeting event.                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-out)
MGI:3028946	Cited1<tm1Dunw>	The entire coding region was deleted via cre-mediated recombiantion of the loxP sites inserted by homologous recombination. While the targeting vector included an frt-flanked neo cassette and sequence encoding GFP, GFP expression was undetected. Sequence  analysis of the targted locus identified a single base insertion, resulting in a frameshift mutation in the inserted sequence.

MGI:2135533	Pdgfrb<tm4Sor>	A to T transversions in the sequences corresponding to codons 739 and 750 were introduced that altered the corresponding amino acids from tyrosine to phenylalanine. In addition, a mutation was introduced that altered the sequences of the codon correspondi ng to 1020 from a tyrosine to an isoleucine (DNA alteration not specified). These mutations are predicted to disrupt the PI3-K and PLC-gamma binding sites in the protein.  A loxP flanked neomycin cassette was inserted into an adjacent intron.  Removal of  this neomycin cassette had no effect on the phenotype, and analysis of mice with or without the neomycin casstte was not distinguished in the paper.

MGI:2183167	Gabra3<tm1Uru>	A point mutation was introduced into codon 126 (exon 4) resulting in the substitution of histidine with arginine. The targeting vector also contained a floxed neomycin cassette in intron 3 for selection. A silent mutation was introduced at codon 150, gene rating a novel KpnI site. Mice carrying this allele were bred with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase to generate Gabra3<tm1.1Uru>.

MGI:2183168	Gabra3<tm1.1Uru>	This allele was generated by breeding mice carrying Gabra3<tm1Uru> with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase via the EIIa promoter. The floxed neomycin cassette was excised from intron 3, while the point mutation in codon 126 that results in a histi dine to arginine substitution remained intact. Western blot analysis showed that the substitution did not affect expression of the protein. Autoradiographs of parasagittal brain sections showed novel diazepam-insensitve sites in regions where the endogeno us protein is expressed, indicating the disruption of the drug-binding site.

MGI:2183169	Gabra5<tm1Uru>	A point mutation was introduced into codon 105 (exon 4) resulting in the substitution of histidine with arginine. The targeting vector also contained a floxed neomycin cassette in intron 3 for selection. Mice carrying this allele were bred with transgenic  mice expressing cre recombinase to generate Gabra5<tm1.1Uru>.

MGI:2183170	Gabra5<tm1.1Uru>	This allele was generated by breeding mice carrying Gabra5<tm1Uru> with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase via the EIIa promoter. The floxed neomycin cassette was excised from intron 3, while the point mutation in codon 105 that results in a histi dine to arginine substitution remained intact. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of the encoded protein was decreased by approximately 20% in homozygous mutant mice. Autoradiographs showed novel diazepam-insensitve sites in regions where th e endogenous protein is expressed, indicating the disruption of the drug-binding site.

MGI:2183298	Apob<tm1.1Zc>	Deletion of nucleotide 5449 in exon 26 and a loxP-flanked PGK-neo cassette inserted into intron 24 were introduced to the gene via homologous recombination. This deletion mimics the ApoB-38.9 truncation mutation found in human familial hypobetalipoprotein emia (FHBL). The neo cassette was removed by transient expression of Cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells. Southern blot analysis confirmed the absence of the neo cassette in homozygous mutant mice; Western blot analysis showed a mutant protein  product of similar size to the human ApoB-38.9 mutant protein.

MGI:2183299	Apob<tm1Zc>	Deletion of nucleotide 5449 in exon 26 and a loxP-flanked PGK-neo cassette inserted into intron 24 were introduced to the gene via homologous recombination. The single nucleotide deletion should result in a truncated protein similar to the apoB-38.9 mutat ion found in human familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL). Western blot analysis of homozygous mutants showed an unexpected mutant protein similar to apoB-27.6, a smaller form of mutant protein found in FHBL. Southern blot analysis of homozygous mutant a nimals showed the gene was correctly targeted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183321	Cebpa<tm1(Cebpb)Ylee>	A Cebpb knockin was generated by replacing the entire coding region of the Cebpa locus with the Cebpb coding region. A floxed neomycin selection cassette was inserted downstream of the stop codon. Homozygous mutant mice were bred with transgenic mice expr essing cre recombinase, driven by the EIIa promoter, to generate mice carrying Cebpa<tm1.1(Cebpb)Ylee>.                                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183333	Cebpa<tm1.1(Cebpb)Ylee>	This allele was generated by breeding mice homozygous for Cenpa<tm1(Cebpb)Ylee> with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase, driven by the EIIa promoter. Expression of cre resulted in the excision of the floxed neo gene downstream of the stop codon. T he Cebpb coding region inserted at the endogenous start codon to replace the coding region of Cebpa remained intact. Northern blot analysis confirmed the absence of Cebpa mRNA and the presence of the Cebpa/Cebpb hybrid mRNA in homozygous mutant mice. West ern blot analysis showed that Cebpb protein levels were concomitant with the combined amount of Cebpb and Cebpa/Cebpb transcript until the age of 7 weeks.                                                                                                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183358	Tbp<tm1Ees>	The majority of exon 3 was replaced with 2 tandem copies of the FLAG epitope tag and a loxP-flanked MC1-neo cassette was inserted 2.5 kb upstream of the promoter via homologous recombination.                                                                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183359	Tbp<tm1.1Ees>	Animals heterozygous for Tbp<tm1Ees> were crossed to a cre-expressing line to facilitate excision of the neomycin resistance cassette. The resulting chimeric protein is composed of amino acids 1-24 followed by 2 tandem repeats of the FLAG tag and the enti re C-terminus (amino acids 136-316). RNase protection assay and Western blot analysis confirmed that gene expression and steady-state accumulation of the protein in homozygous mutant animals is similar to that of the wild type protein.                    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183367	Thrb<tm2Few>	The deletion of 3 base pairs in exon 6 corresponding with a deletion that results in thyroid horomone resistance in humans was introduced via site-directed mutagenesis along with a neomycin selection cassette inserted into intron 5. The mutation in exon 6  affects the ligand-binding domain which is common to both isofroms produced from this locus. Presence of the mutation was confirmed via an RNAse protection assay and sequence analysis.                                                                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183389	Gata1<tm4Sho>	A valine to glycine substitute at amino acid 205 (V205G) of exon 4 and a floxed neo cassette insertion in the downstream intron were introduced to the gene via homologous recombination. The V205G mutation disrupts the FOG-binding region without affecting  DNA-binding ability, and, in humans, results in severe congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia. The neo cassette was removed by transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells.                                       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183390	Gata2<tm2Sho>	A valine to glycine substitute at amino acid 296 (V296G) of exon 4, a floxed neo cassette insertion in the downstream intron, and a loxP site upstream of exon 4, were introduced to the gene via homologous recombination. The V296G mutation disrupts the FOG -binding region without affecting DNA-binding ability. The neo cassette was removed by transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells.                                                                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183408	Rarg<tm1Lhn>	Exon 5 of the endogenous allele, which contains the translational start site for the gamma2 isoform, was disrupted by the insertion of a cassette containing a Rarg cDNA modified via site-directed mutagenesis to encode glutamic acid at position 305 rather  than glycine. The cassette also contained a floxed TK-neo fusion gene that was excised via the in vitro expression of cre. RT-PCR analysis of ES cells confirmed the expression of the mutant allele.                                                          	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183410	Olig2<tm1(cre)Yin>	The portion of exon 2 encoding the basic helix-loop-helix domain was deleted by the insertion of a cassette containing neo and tamoxifen-inducible cre transgenes. The expression of the inducible cre transgene was driven by the endogenous promoter.        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183413	Lig1<tm3Dwm>	A C to T transversion at position 771 (exon 23) resulted in the substitution of Arg with Trp, a mutation initially identified in a patient with symptoms similar to Bloom's syndrome. Sequence analysis of RT-PCR products confirmed that the point mutation in  exon 23 was the only change in the coding region of the endogenous gene.	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183640	Wt1<tm1Asc>	A GT to GC mutation at the +2 position of intron 9 and a floxed neo cassette (also in intron 9) were introduced via homologous recombination. The point mutation is found in patients with Frasier syndrome and results in an alternative splice product ablate d for 3 amino acids between zinc fingers 3 and 4 called the KTS region. The neo cassette was removed by transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells. RT-PCR analysis using primers to exons 9 and 10 demonstrated the presence of on ly -KTS transcripts in homozygous mutant animals. The +KTS transcript is completely absent.                                                                                                                                                                    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183642	Wt1<tm2Asc>	A GT to GG mutation at the first splice donor site of exon 9 and a floxed neo cassette in intron 9 were introduced via homologous recombination. The point mutation results in an alternative splice product retaining the 3 amino acids between zinc fingers 3  and 4 called the KTS region. The neo cassette was removed by transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells. RT-PCR analysis using primers to exons 9 and 10 demonstrated the presence of only +KTS transcripts in homozygous mutant a nimals. The -KTS transcript is completely absent.

MGI:2183740	Lat<tm2Lov>	Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations were introduced at positions identified as being critical for the binding of signaling molecules (136, 175, 195, and 235) via site-directed mutagenesis. A floxed neomycin selection cassette was inserted downstream of th e coding region. Mice carrying this allele were bred with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase via the EIIa promoter to generate Lat<tm2.1Lov>.

MGI:2183741	Lat<tm2.1Lov>	This allele was generated by breeding mice carrying Lat<tm2Lov> with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase via the EIIa promoter. Expression of cre resulted in the excision of the floxed neo cassette, leaving the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations a t positions identified as being critical for the binding of signaling molecules (136, 175, 195, and 235) intact. Flow cytometric analysis of thymocytes from homozygous mutants showed reduced levels of protein.                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183790	Timp3<tm1Web>	Site-directed mutagenesis of codon 156 (exon 5) resulted in a serine to cysteine substitution. A floxed neomycin selection cassette inserted into intro 4 was excised via the in vitro expression of cre recombinase. Sequence analysis showed that a normal si zed transcript detected by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses contained the desired missense mutation. Western blot analysis of ECM protein extracts confirmed proper translation of the mutant transcript.                                                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183833	Runx2<tm1Gss>	A nonsense mutation was introduced after codon 376 of exon 8 resulting in deletion of the C-terminal region of the protein, which includes the nuclear matrix targeting signal (NMTS), and floxed TK-neo cassette was inserted into the intron preceding exon 8 . Transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted cells facilitated removal of the TK-neo cassette. RT-PCR analysis and Western blot confirmed the expression of the truncated gene product in homozygous mutant animals. Sequence analysis of th e RT-PCR product confirmed the presence of the premature stop codon in exon 8.                                                                                                                                                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183897	Psap<tm2Suz>	An amino acid substitution was introduced into the saposin A domain of the gene utilizing a Cre/loxP system.  Specifically, the mutation was introduced into exon 4 of the gene, changing the fourth cysteine in saposin A to phenylalanine (C106F).  This resu lted in the loss of one of three conserved disulfide bonds within the protein.   Animals carrying this allele produced stable mRNA of normal length.                                                                                                           	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183945	Ercc1<tm2Jhjh>	A stop codon was introduced at position 292 to shorten the protein by 7 residues, 2 of which are in the essential domain. Expression and sequence analysis showed message to be transcribed and processed properly in homozygous mutant mice. RT-PCR analysis r evealed levels of transcript to be approximately 15% of those in wild type mice. Further analysis showed that transcription of the antisense gene was unaffected by the targeting event.                                                                       	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2183949	Ercc2<tm2(ERCC2)Jhjh>	To recapitulate the photosensitive form of trichothiodystrophy, part of exon 22 and all of exon 23 were replaced with a fragment of human cDNA, containing an arginine to tryptophan missense mutation. Northern blot analysis of total testicular RNA showed o verexpression of the mutant transcript. Protein level analysis was not possible due to the lack of an antibody that detects the hybrid protein.                                                                                                                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2384074	Fos<tm1(Fosl1)Wag>	Exon 1 of the Fos locus was replaced with the entire Fosl1 coding sequence followed by stop codons. A floxed neo cassette was inserted for selection and subsequently excised from ES cells via cre mediated recombination. Because Fos mRNA levels are in part  controlled by a destabilizing region in the 3' UTR, Fos sequence downstream of the Fosl1 insertion was left intact, though affected by a frameshift mutation introduced by the insertion. The lack of aberrant transcripts was verified by RT-PCR analysis. RN Ase protection assays confirmed that the expression pattern of the inserted Fosl1 recapitulated that of the endogenous Fos gene.                                                                                                                               	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2384081	Fgg<tm1Jld>	A nonsense mutation was introduced at the last codon of exon 9 via site directed mutagenesis and subsequent homologous recombination, precluding the translation of 5 carboxy terminal residues (407 through 411). Due to its position at the 3' end of exon 9,  the mutation does not affect residues involved in transglutaminase crosslinking and is insensitive to the known splice variation involving exon 10. Northern blot analysis of total hepatic RNA showed that the mutation did not effect expression of any of t he three fibrinogen polypeptides (alpha, beta, and gamma). Levels of circulating the fibrinogen complex were determined to be unaffected in mutant mice by Western blot analysis and quantitative capture ELISA of plasma.

MGI:2384161	Cdkn2a<tm1Brn>	A nonsense mutation was generated at position 101 of the p16<Ink4a> open reading frame and a floxed neo cassette was inserted upstream of exon 2. Cdkn2a<tm1.1Brn> was generated by breeding mice harboring this allele with transgenic mice expressing cre rec ombinase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2384165	Cdkn2a<tm1.1Brn>	This allele was generated by excising the floxed neo cassette from Cdkn2a<tm1Brn> by breeding with transgenic mice expressing cre. The presence of a stop codon at position 101 of the p16Ink4a open reading frame precluded the translation of the fourth anky rin motif of p16<Ink4a>. While p16<Ink4a> was undetected by Western blot analysis or immunoprecipitation, the expression of p19<ARF> was unaffected in homozygous mutant mice.                                                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2384391	Ntrk2<tm1Lfr>	The first exon (exon S) was replaced with a floxed full-length cDNA copy of the gene followed by a PGK-neo-loxP cassette and a tau-lacZ cassette. The PGK-neo-loxP cassette was removed in correctly targeted ES cells via transient expression of cre recombin ase leaving the floxed cDNA and tau-lacZ cassette intact. Expression of the floxed cDNA is under the control of the endogenous promoter. The tau-lacZ sequence is not transcribed due to SV40 polyadenylation signals and multiple stop codons following the fl oxed cDNA. Northern blot analysis of brain from homozygous mutant animals shows the presence of only full-length transcripts. Multiple alternative transcripts observed in wild type animals are absent. Gene expression and protein expression in mutant anima ls is approximately 33% and 24% that of wild type, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that only full-length protein, and no protein isoforms, are expressed in mutant animals, and the pattern of expression is similar to wild type.     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2384410	Csf3r<tm2Link>	A C to T mutation at nucleotide 2403 of the cDNA was introduced via site directed mutatgenesis and homologous recombination. The mutation generates a stop codon that truncates 96 carboxy terminal residues and thereby recapitulates a mutation observed in a  human patient with both congenital neutropenia and acute myeloid leukemia. RT-PCR and restriction enzyme analyses showed that homozygous mutant mice lacked normal transcript and expressed mutant transcript at normal levels.                               	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2384412	Csf3r<tm3Link>	Two point mutations generated by site directed mutagenesis were introduced at this locus by homologous recombination. A nonsense mutation at nucleotide 2403 resulted in the truncation of 96 carboxy terminal residues. An additional mutation at nucleotide 2 362 mutated codon 704 to encode a phenylalanine rather than a tyrosine.

MGI:2384424	Hbb-b1<tm1Shs>	A missense mutation (Asn to Lys) generated at codon 108 via site directed mutagenesis was incorporated, along with an intronic floxed neo cassette, at the endogenous locus by homologous recombination. This mutation recapitulates the mutation responisble f or Presbyterian hemoglobinopathy. The amino acid substitution was confirmed by RP-HPLC and mass-spectrometric analysis of purified beta chain.

MGI:2384510	Kcna5<tm1(Kcna1)Lndn>	A construct containing rat Kcna1 sequence appended with a hemagglutinin tag (HA) and neo was incorporated at the enodogenous locus via homologous recombination. The rat sequence was inserted such that it would replace the Kcna5 coding sequence and be expr essed by the Kcna5 promoter. Northern blot analysis confirmed the absence of Kcna5, while the presence of the rat Kcna1 was detected by RT-PCR analysis. HA epitope directed antibodies showed a 62 kDa protein in the heart tissue obtained from mutant mice,  but not in brain tissue.

MGI:2385709	Hoxa2<tm1(tetO)Mllo>	Seven copies of the tetracycline operator were inserted in the 5' untranslated region of the endogenous locus via homologous recombination. An RNAse protection assay revealed the inserted sequence to be approximately 100 bp upstream of the transcriptional  start site. While quantitative analysis of the amount of transcript produced by the mutant allele showed a 55% reduction relative to the wild type allele, in situ hybridization indicated that the pattern of expression was unaffected.                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2385727	Lhx1<tm3Bhr>	A floxed neo cassette was inserted into intron 1 via homologous recombination. The 5' and 3' arms of homology were modified to contain two missense mutations affecting conserved cysteine residues in both exons 1 and 2, which encode the LIM domains essenti al for zinc-finger structure.

MGI:2385728	Lhx1<tm3.1Bhr>	The neo cassette inserted into intron 1 of Lhx<tm3Bhr> was excised via the in vivo ubiquitous expression of cre recombinase. The four missense mutations affecting conserved cysteine residues in exons 1 and 2, encoding the two LIM domains, were left intact . The conservation of the endogenous expression pattern was verified by whole mount in situ hybridization of homozygous mutant embryos. RT-PCR and sequence analyses showed normal expression and the exclusive presence of the missense mutations. Finally, im munocytochemical analysis confirmed the presence of protein in mutant mice.

MGI:2385778	Esr1<tm2Ksk>	Missense mutations (leucine to alanine) of the first two codons encoding hydrophobic residues were introduced in exon 9, which encodes the AF-2 motif. Previous in vitro studies showed that the disruption of these residues conferred insensitivity to estrad iol. Sequence encoding a carboxy terminal histidine epitope tag was also added to allow for detection of the mutant protein. A floxed neo cassette that was inserted into the 3' untranslated region was excised from ES cells via expression of cre recombinas e. RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from ES cells showed greater amounts of transcript after the expression of cre than prior to it, indicating that presence of neo affected mRNA stability. Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis of ES cell e xtracts revealed low levels of mutant protein.

The resultant histidine to c ysteine substitution (H168C) recapitulates an amino acid change observed in a human leukodystrophy. RT-PCR and sequence analyses identified two species of message in homozygous mutant mice; a normal length (450 bp) transcript containing the missense mutat ion and a 900 bp transcript produced by aberrant splicing of intron 4. Normal levels of normal length transcript were detected by Northern blot analysis, while the aberrant transcript was not.

MGI:2386273	Trp53<tm1Glo>	A two-step procedure was employed to introduce an arginine to histidine substitute at residue 172 (R172H), the equivalent of R175H in humans. First, a neo-derived cassette replaced exons 2-6 by homologous recombination. Next, a vector containing exons 2-6  and carrying a CGC to CAC missense mutation at codon 172 was used to replace the neo cassette and reconstitute the gene. SSCP confirmed successful integration of the mutant allele and restriction digest analysis confirmed reconstitution of the gene. Immu noprecipitation experiments with mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from homozygous mutant embryos showed that mutant protein is expressed at a level similar to wild type. RT-PCR analysis detected full-length transcript and 2 mutant transcripts involving  exon 3 deletions due to a mutation at the splice acceptor site of intron 2.

MGI:2386437	Foxa1<tm1(cre)Sew>	The majority of exon 2 was replaced with a cassette containing NLS-cre.                                                                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2386592	Vegfa<tm3Pec>	Genomic sequence containing exons 4 through 8 were replaced with a cDNA containing exons 4, 5, 7, and 8. In addition a floxed neo cassette was inserted into the the 3' untranslated region. Mice carrying this allele were utilized to generate Vegfa<tm3.1Pec >.

MGI:2386593	Vegfa<tm3.1Pec>	The floxed neo cassette was excised from Vegfa<tm3Pec> by the in vivo expression of cre recombinase, leaving the isoform specific cDNA replacement intact. The resultant allele lacks exon 6 as well as splice sites and thereby produces a single isoform with  intermediate solubility and receptor binding properties. The exclusive presence of this isoform was verified by quatitative RT-PCR.                                                                                                                           	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2386595	Vegfa<tm4Pec>	Genomic sequence containing exons 4 through 8 was replaced with corresponding cDNA. The resultant allele lacks splice sites and thereby produces a single isoform with high receptor binding properties. The exclusive presence of this isoform was verified by  quatitative RT-PCR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2386669	Sca1<tm2Zuk>	An expanded tract of 78 CAG repeats was engineered and knocked into exon 8 and a floxed neo-TK cassette was inserted into the upstream intron via  homologous recombination. Transient expression of cre recombinase in correctly targeted ES cells removed the  neo-TK cassette. Expression of the mutant allele was verified by Western blot analysis of brain protein extracts. The CAG expansion mimics mutations found in human spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 patients with CAG expansions ranging from 40-83 repeats.    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2386671	Inhba<tm2Zuk>	A portion of exon 2 was replaced with the mature domain of Inhbb and a neomycin resistance cassette was inserted into the downstream intron via homologous recombination. In situ hybridization, RNase protection assay, and Western blot verified the absence  of Inhba expression in homozygous mutant animals.                                                                                                                                                                                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2386764	Gata4<tm1Sho>	The endogenous gene was targeted with a construct in which codon 217 had been modified by site directed mutagensis to encode glycine rather than valine. The targeted residue (corresponding with Val 205 in the human protein) lies within the N finger domain  and is involved in zinc finger protein binding. A floxed neo cassette was inserted in the intron following the exon containing the substitution mutation. Comparision with mice carrying Gata4<tm1.1Sho> indicated that the intronic neo cassette did not affe ct gene expression.

MGI:2387293	Runx1<tm1Dez>	A construct containing the 5' region of murine exon 5 joined to the 3' region of human exon 5 followed by the entire CBFA2T1 coding region was inserted at the endogenous locus via homologous recombination. The targeted allele generates a fusion protein si milar to the fusion protein resulting from T(8;21) which is associated with the M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Transcription of the allele was verified in heterozygous mice by a protection assay.                                               	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2387300	Runx1<tm2Dow>	The endogenous locus was targeted with a construct containing human cDNA derived from t(8;21), a translocation observed in leukaemic cells of patients with the M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The human sequence included 62 bp of exon 4 and all  of exon 5 of RUNX1 fused to a portion of CBFA2T1. This RUNX1-CBFA2T1 sequence was fused in frame 95 bp into exon 4 of the endogenous murine gene. Hybrid transcript was detected by RT-PCR analysis of differentiated ES cells.                               	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2387301	Runx1<tm3Dow>	A floxed stop cassette containing a strong polyA signal was inserted into intron 3, upstream of the murine/human hybrid sequence engineered from human t(8;21) cDNA and used to generate Runx1<tm2Dow>. While trace levels of an alternatively spliced transcri pt including the downstream region were detected, no such protein was identified in mutant mice by Western blot analysis. Excision of the floxed polyA signal and the resultant expression of the inserted human sequence was achieved when mice carrying this  allele were bred with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase.                                                                                                                                                                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2387351	Tcfe2a<tm2Zhu>	The DNA binding domain of the E47 isoform was disrupted by the introduction of two arginine to glycine missense mutations generated by site directed mutagenesis. While this mutation putatively disrupts DNA binding it was not expected to affect homodimeriz ation of the E47 isoform. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed a 40% reduction of transcript produced from the targeted locus. The mutation was shown to affect splicing as the E47/E12 transcript ratio was determined to be increased by approximately 80%  in homozygous mutant mice.

The mutation deletes the first 87 residues, which includes a putative  transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis of spleen RNA using probes to the deleted region did not detect gene transcript in homozygous mutant animals.                                                                                                    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2387445	Ret<tm1(RET)Vpa>	A cDNA fragment encoding the intracelluar portion of the human RET9 isoform was fused in-frame with mouse exon 11 immediately downstream of the transmembrane domain-coding region. A floxed PGK-neo cassette followed the human cDNA sequence for positive sel ection. RT-PCR analysis and Western blot using allele-specific primers and antibodies, respectively, confirmed expression of the chimeric gene product in homozygous mutant animals. Semiquanititative RT-PCR and Western blot also determined the expression l evel of the mutant allele was similar to that of wild type.

MGI:2388916	Zap70<tm2Mmal>	A tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution at residue 315 (Y315F) was introduced into exon 7 and a floxed neo cassette was inserted into the intron upstream of exon 3 via homologous recombination.                                                             	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2388918	Zap70<tm2.1Mmal>	The intronic floxed neo cassette was excised from Zap70<tm2Mmal> animals by crossing to a cre-expressing deleter strain, leaving behind a tyrosine to phenylalanine knock-in mutation at position 315 (Y315F). Expression of the mutant allele was confirmed by  sequence analysis of RT-PCR products from thymus of mutant animals.                                                                                                                                                                                           	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2388978	Csf3r<tm4(Epor)Link>	Exons 16 and 17 of the endogenous gene, which encode the cytoplasmic domain, were replaced by an Epor cDNA fragment. The resultant allele encodes a chimeric receptor with the endogenous extracytoplasmic (ligand binding) and transmembrane regions adjoined  to the Epor cytoplasmic (signaling) region. Flow cytometric and ligand binding assays indicated that the chimeric receptor had normal binding affinity and was expressed on the surface of homozygous mutant neutrophils at a level approximately 80% of normal  expression.

MGI:2389040	Tagln<tm1(cre/ESR1)Feil>	An allele encoding a tissue specific and ligand dependent recombinase was generated by inserting cre recombinase/modified estrogen receptor (ESR1) fusion sequence into the endogenous allele. The ESR1 sequence contained engineered missense mutations at pos itions 400, 543, 540 which substituted the ability to bind the endogenous ligand with the ability to bind tamoxifen (J:79835). Histochemical analysis of mutant mice treated with tamoxifen showed expression of the transgene in smooth muscle tissue.        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2389125	Hoxd11<tm2(Hoxd11)Mrc>	A second copy of the Hoxd11 coding region and surrounding sequence was inserted at the endogenous locus. The construct also contained a floxed neomycin selection cassette.                                                                                    	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2389127	Hoxd11<tm2.1(Hoxd11)Mrc>	The floxed neo cassette was excised from Hoxd11<tm2(Hoxd11)Mrc> via in vivo cre mediated recombination. The second copy of the Hoxd11 coding region and surrounding sequence inserted upstream of the endogenous Hoxd11 coding region was left intact. In situ  hybridization indicated overexpression of Hoxd11 transcript.                                                                                                                                                                                                   	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2389254	Camk2a<tm4Sva>	The endogenous sequence encoding threonine residues at positions 305 and 306 was modified to encode valine and alanine by homologous recombination of a site directed mutagenized construct. The replacement of the threonine residues with nonphosphorylatable  amino acids was designed to inhibit autophosphorylation of the targeted residues. Western blot analysis of homozygous mutant mice showed that normal sized protein was present at a level approximately two fold lower than that observed in wild type mice. F urther analysis using antibodies directed against phosphorylated threonine residues 305 and 286 showed immunoreactivity for only the latter. A single loxP site was left within the locus.                                                                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2389272	Camk2a<tm5Sva>	Sequence encoding threonine 305 was targeted by homologous recombination of a construct containing an engineered arginine substitution mutation. The replacement of the this threonine residue with the negatively charged argnine was designed to interfere wi th calcium/calmodulin binding. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of a normal sized protein. A single loxP site was left within the locus.                                                                                                         	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2389309	Camk2a<tm1Mllr>	The endogenous 3' UTR was replaced with a bovine growth hormone 3' UTR. The bovine sequence contains an identical polyadenylation hexanucleotide but lacks a dendritic localization signal. In situ hybridization of mutant brain sections indicated that dendr itic loczalization was disrupted. Quantification of the hybridization results showed reduced expression levels in hippocampal cell bodies (approximately 85.3% of wild type).

MGI:2429412	Gt(ROSA)26Sor<tm1(FLP1)Dym>	An enhanced flp cassette containing a splice acceptor site was ligated to a downstream PGK-neo cassette and inserted at the endogenous locus. Efficient frt-specific recombination in transgenic mice carrying a reporter gene was reported to reflect constitu itive expression of the Gt(ROSA)26Sor from preimplantation onward.                                                                                                                                                                                             	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2429435	Sca1<tm1Hzo>	An expanded tract of 154 CAG repeats was engineered and knocked into exon 8. Additionally, a floxed neo-TK cassette was inserted into the upstream intron and subsequently deleted in ES cells via cre mediated recombination. While equivalent transcript leve ls were identified in both mutant and wild type mice by RT-PCR, reduced levels of mutant protein were observed in brain tissue. The authors attributed this apparent reduction in protein level to an increased difficulty of extraction or solubilization due  to the mutant protein accumulating into nuclear aggregates as mice age.	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2429496	Ckap3<tm2(Gap43)Crni>	A construct, containing Gap43 sequence followed by IRES-NLS-LacZ and neo, was inserted at the endogenous locus. Northern blot analysis of homozygous mutant mice confirmed the presence of Gap43 transcript produced from the inserted sequence as well as the  absence of Ckap3 transcript.

MGI:2429632	Pou4f2<tm1(ALPP)Kln>	The endogenous locus was disrupted by the insertion of a construct containing human placental alkaline phosphatase (ALPP) followed by a neo cassette.                                                                                                          	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2429642	Emr1<tm1(cre)Kpf>	The insertion of a targeting vector replaced endogenous coding sequence with cre and neo. Northern blot and immunohistochemical analyses indicated the absence of transcript and protein in homozygous mutant mice. Recombination of a floxed reporter verified  translation of a functional cre recombinase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2429773	Snca<tm1Wtd>	A floxed region containing neo and a transcriptional blocking sequence (STOP) was followed by human sequence encoding a modified Snca gene. This construct was incorporated 7 bp upstream of the endogenous start codon via homologous recombination. Northern  and Western blot analyses of homozygous mutant mice indicated a complete ablation of gene expression. The positioning of the human sequence downstream of the transcription blocking cassette precluded its expression.                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2429948	Kras2<tm4Tyj>	By homologous recombination in ES cells, the Kras2 locus was targeted with a cassette containing an oncogenic form of the KRAS2 protein in which the glycine at position 12 had been substituted with a an aspartic acid. A loxP flanked stop codon was include d upstream of the inserted Kras2 sequence, such that the mutant transcript would be expressed only after cre-mediated recombination.

MGI:2429992	Gata1<tm5(GATA3)Sho>	Sequence extending from the start codon in exon 2 to the EcoRI site in exon 3 was replaced with a construct containing human GATA3 cDNA sequence followed by a floxed PGK-neo cassette. Northern blot analyses of cell lines derived from mutant embryos indica ted that a transcript comprised of both GATA3 and Gata1 sequence was expressed in erythroid cells (but not in myeloid cells). The presence of a protein translated from GATA3 sequence was verified by immunostaining. No Gata1 protein was detected.          	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2445311	Gt(ROSA)26Sor<tm1(cre/Esr1)Brn>	A splice acceptor site followed by a cre gene and puromycin resistance cassette was inserted at the ROSA26 gene trap locus. Efficient Cre-mediated recombination in transgenic mice carrying floxed reporter genes was reported to reflect constituitive expres sion of the Gt(ROSA)26Sor from preimplantation stages onward.                                                                                                                                                                                                  	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2445429	Pitx2<tm4(cre)Jfm>	Exon 5, which encodes a portion of the homeodomain, was disrupted by the insertion of a cassette containing IRES, cre recombinase, lacZ, and neo. In situ hybridization results showed that the expression pattern of cre was similar to that of the endogenous  gene.

MGI:2445438	Rb1<tm1Jyjw>	An aspartic acid to alanine mutation was introduced into the caspase cleavage site of exon 25 and a diagnostic EcoRI site was introduced into intron 24 via homologous recombination. A floxed neo cassette was also inserted into intron 25. Correctly targete d ES cells subjected to caspase activation did not show diminishment of Rb protein, thus confirming the mutation to the caspase cleavage site.

MGI:2445439	Rb1<tm1.1Jyjw>	This mutant is derived from Rb1<tm1Jyjw>. The floxed neo cassette in intron 25 was removed by mating Rb1<tm1Jyjw> animals to cre-expressing line TgN(Prm-cre)58Og. Resulting progeny contain the aspartic acid to alanine mutation in the caspase cleavage site  of exon 25 and the diagnostic EcoRI site in intron 24.                                                                                                                                                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2445461	Pax8<tm1Mbu>	The gene was disrupted by replacement of exon 3 with an in-frame cre recombinase and frt-flanked neo cassette via homologous recombination. The targeted mutation deletes the N-terminal portion of the paired domain, which is essential for DNA-binding.     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2446434	En1<tm6(cre)Alj>	A cre recombinase gene cassette was inserted into the En1 locus.  A loxP flanked neomycin cassette is removed in vivo via a Cre-mediated recombination event.                                                                                                  	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2446469	Psen1<tm2Psgh>	A methionine to leucine missense mutation (M146L) was introduced into exon 6 via homologous recombination of a construct modified by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and containing a neomycin selection cassette approximately 150 bp into intron 6. The expected mut ant transcript was undetected by Northern blot analysis, putatively due to an affect of neo cassette on either expression or proper splicing. Low levels of transcript (0.5 to 1% of wild type) were detected by RT-PCR analysis of RNA obtained from the brain  and dorsal spinal cord, however no protein was identified by Western blot analysis. Accumulations of amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein (APP) fragments resulting from alpha- and beta-cleavage in the absence of gamma-cleavage further indicated the comple te loss of normal protein expression.

MGI:2447429	Apoe<tm1Khw>	A threonine to arginine substitution was introduced into amino acid 61 (T61R) of mouse Apoe exon 3 and a floxed neo cassette was inserted into the downstream intron via homologous recombination. This mutation allows the mouse protein to mimic human APOE4  domain interaction. The presence of the neo cassette renders this allele hypomorphic with mRNA expression at 2%-5% that of wild type. Expression of the mutant allele was observed by Western blot analysis.                                                   	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2447431	Apoe<tm1.1Khw>	This allele is derived from Apoe<tm1Khw> by mating mutant animals to a cre deleter strain. Resulting progeny are removed of the floxed neo cassette between exons 3 and 4 leaving behind a threonine to arginine substitution at amino acid 61 (T61R). This mut ation allows the mouse protein to mimic human APOE4 domain interaction. Removal of the neo cassette resulted in normal levels of gene expression comparable to that of wild type. Expression of the mutant allele was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of se veral tissue types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2447454	Cd79a<tm2Cgn>	The translation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) was precluded by the generation of a nonsense mutation at codon 181 (exon 4). Sequence analysis revealed that the incorporation of a targeting vector containing a floxed neo cass ette downstream of the endogenous locus and tyrosine to phenylalanine missense mutations in the ITAM resulted in a 5 nt deletion (4506 to 4510) thereby generating the stop codon at position 181. The neo cassette was excised in vitro via cre mediated recom bination. The resultant protein was expected to lack 40 carboxy terminal amino acids, and thus retain B cell surface Ig expression but lack endogenous signaling.

MGI:2447628	Pold1<tm1Bdp>	A point mutation resulting in an aspartic acid to alanine substition at residue 400 was introduced at the endogenous locus by homologous recombination of a targeting vector also carrying an intronic neo cassette. The missense mutation was introduced into  sequence encoding the proofreading domain. RT-PCR analysis of heterozygous ES cells showed comparable levels of wild type and mutant transcript. Western blot analysis of fibroblasts derived from mutant mice further indicated normal levels of expression.  	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2447758	Isl1<tm1(cre)Cos>	An IRES-Cre-SV40pA cassette was inserted into the exon encoding the second LIM domain of Isl1.

MGI:2447783	Zfpn1a1<tm1(Pax5)Mbu>	A construct containing a floxed neo cassette, Pax5 gene, and GFP gene was inserted into the Znfn1a1 locus upstream of the translation initiation codon in exon 2. Western blot analysis using antibodies against C-terminal Znfn1a1 sequences did not detect pr otein product in thymocytes from homozygous mutant animals.

The floxed neo cassette was subsequently removed by mating mutant animals to cre deleter strain TgN(EIIa-cre)C5379Lmgd. The integrity of the V558 deletion was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.                                                 	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2664368	Apex1<tm2Cur>	A cysteine to alanine missense mutation was generated at codon 64 in exon 2 by site directed mutagenesis. An artifactual loxP site remained in intron 2 after the floxed neo selection cassette was removed by in vitro cre mediated recombination. The incorpo ration of the missense mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis and protein levels similar to those of wild type were detected by Western blot anlaysis of homozygous mutant mice.

MGI:2664917	Actn4<tm1Plk>	A Lys256Glu mutation, such as is associated with familial focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was introduced into exon 8. In addition, a loxP flanked neomycin-resistance cassette was inserted 400 base pairs 3' of exon 8.  Contrary to expectation s the resulting homozygous mice failed to express the mutated gene as was indicated by Northern and Western blots.

MGI:2670783	Fes<tm1Pag>	A dinucleotide substitution was introduced at codon 588 (exon 14), converting the lysine codon to an arginine codon. While protein was detected at wild type levels in homozygous mutant mice, the absence of lysine 588, a conserved residue of the kinase sub domain II, resulted in an ablation of catalytic activity. The targeting construct also included neo and tk selection genes in the 3' untranslated region.

MGI:2675580	Hdh<tm1Mfc>	A fragment extending from 18 bp upstream of the polyglutamine stretch in exon 1 to 100 bp into intron 1 was replaced with human HD sequence containing 140 CAG repeats. A floxed neo cassette was retained 1.3 kb upstream of exon 1. Western blot analysis of  homozygous mutant cerebellum and forebrain tissues identified protein corresponding with the mouse/human hybrid protein. Similar levels of mutant and endogenous protein were observed.                                                                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2676327	Gja1<tm2(cre/ESR1)Kwi>	The coding region was replaced with a construct encoding a tamoxifen dependent cre recombinase. The cre recombinase coding region was joined to sequence encoding the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor with a glycine to arginine missense  mutation at position 521. This substitution enables the domain to bind to tamoxifen while ablating the estradiol binding ability. Tamoxifen treatment permits the translocation of the cre hybrid protein to the nucleus.                                      	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2676917	Glra1<tm1Rah>	Exon 7 was modified so that the codon for serine at amino acid position 267 (AGC) has been changed to one that codes for glutamine (CAG).  At the same time, a neomycine resistance gene flanked by FLP recombinase target sites.  F1 heterozygotes were mated  to FLP general deleter mice to remove the neo marker gene.                                                                                                                                                                                                     	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2676923	Thrb<tm3Few>	Missense mutations were introduced at codons 125 and 126 (exon 3), resulting in Glu to Gly and Gly to Ser substitutions. The substitutions were within the P-box of the first zinc finger and were shown, in vitro, to abolish DNA-binding while retaining the  ability to interact with T3 and cofactors. The mutations were verified by sequencing RT-PCR products. The self-excision of a neo cassette from intron 3 was confirmed, leaving a single loxP site. Western blot analysis showed endogenous levels of protein in  homozygous mutant mice.

MGI:2677457	Grb2<tm2Paw>	A G-to-A mutation was introduced into codon 89 to alter this residue in the corresponding protein from a glutamate to a lysine through homologous recombination.  A loxP-flanked neomycin selection cassette also introduced into intron 2 was deleted by cre-m ediated recombination, resulting in a single loxP site remaining in the intron.  This allele expresses a mutant protein and is thought to be hypomorphic.

MGI:2678763	Opn1mw<tm1(OPN1LW)Nat>	Human cDNA encoding OPN1LW was inserted at the endogenous mouse Opn1mw locus, replacing a 3' portion of exon 2 and all of exons 3, 4, and 5. The allele putatively produces a hybrid protein consisting of 92 N-terminal residues encoded by mouse exon 1 and t he 5' portion of exon 2, and 266 C-terminal residues encoded by the human cDNA. Nearly the entire chromophore binding pocket, as well as the residues that account for the difference in absorbance spectra between human and mouse, is derived from the human  sequence. Immunostaining indicated expression of the hybrid protein and electroretinogram indicated that the spectral sensitivity of cones containing the targeted allele was similar to that of human red cones.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2679435	Drd2<tm1(IL2RA)Koba>	The human IL2RA gene was inserted into exon 2 of the endogenous locus. Thet targeting construct included a polyadenylation signal and neo gene immediately downstream of IL2RA. Treatment of mutant mice with a recombinant immunotoxin consisting of the varia ble regions of the anti-IL2RA monoclonal antibody fused to a bacterial exotoxin results in the specific ablation of cells expressing IL2RA via the Drd2 promoter.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2680722	Il4ra<tm1Tch>	A single A to T substitution was created at the position equivalent to 1735 of the cDNA.  This caused a codon change for amino acid residue 500 from tyrosine to phenylalanine disrupting the PTB domain.  In addition, a floxed PGK-neomycin resistance casset te was inserted into intron 11.  This cassette was removed from successfully targeted clones by transient transfection with a Cre recombinase.

The neomycin cassette was removed in vivo by breedi ng to Cre deleter mice.   Between 10 and 15% of B cells express this allele.                                                                                                                                                                                   	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2681693	Rag1<tm1Fwa>	The Rag1 coding sequence was replaced with a truncated core Rag-1 sequence followed by a floxed neomycin resistance gene.  The neomycin gene was then removed from properly targeted ES cells by transient transfection with a plasmid based Cre recombinase.   Core Rag1 was expressed at levels comparable to that found for intact protein.

Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2682372	Pdgfrb<tm7Sor>	A point mutation was engineered and incorporated in codon 770 of the endogenous locus via homologous recombination. The mutation results in a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution at a site crucial for RasGAP signal transduction.                         	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2682376	Pdgfrb<tm8Sor>	5 point mutations were engineered and incorporated at the endogenous locus via homologous recombination of a targeting vector. Each mutation elicited a missense mutation, ablating tyrosine residues involved in PI3-K, RasGAP, SHP-2, and PLC-gamma signal tr ansduction. Tyrosines at codons 739, 750, 770, and 1008 are substituted with phenylalanine, and a tyrosine at 1020 is substituted with isoleucine. A single loxP site was left in intron 16.                                                                   	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2682377	Pdgfrb<tm9Sor>	7 point mutations were engineered and incorporated at the endogenous locus via homologous recombination of a targeting vector. Each mutation elicited a missense mutation, ablating tyrosine residues involved in Src, Grb2, PI3-K, RasGAP, SHP-2, and PLC-gamm a signal transduction. Tyrosines at codons 578, 715, 739, 750, 770, and 1008 are substituted with phenylalanine, and a tyrosine at 1020 is substituted with isoleucine. A single FRT and loxP sites were left in introns 12 and 16, respectively.              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2682649	Ets2<tm1Osh>	The ACT codon for threonine at amino acid residue 72 was changed to a GCT alanine codon.  At the same time, the CCC codon for amino acid residue 73 was changed to CCA which eliminated a Pst 1 restriction  site but did not have any other effect.  Finally,  a floxed neomycine gene was inserted in intron 4.  The neomycin resistance gene was removed in vivo by mating to mice expressing Cre recombinase from the protamine promoter in the male germ line.  Production and turnover of the modified protein were simil ar to unmodified protein.

MGI:2682958	Dtr<tm2Mek>	Point mutations were introduced in the cDNA sequence which transformed the amino acids residues at positions 148-149 from Leu-Pro to Ser-Thr.  The modified cDNA sequence was then fused to the start codon of exon 1 along with IRES, a neomycin resistance ge ne and a polyadenylation sequence.  It is predicted that the resulting product would not be cleavable to release the soluble form of the protein.                                                                                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2683089	Hoxb8<tm1Omm>	Missense mutations were incorporated into the LFPWMR motif using a hit and run gene targeting technique. The codons encoding proline and tryptophan were mutated to encode valine and tyrosine, respectively (CCC(P) to GTA(V) and TGG(W) to TAC(Y)). Western b lot analysis of fibroblast extracts the level of mutant protein in homozygous cells to be similar to that of normal protein in wild type cells.                                                                                                                	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2683406	Pparg<tm1Auw>	A hypomorphic allele was generated by inserting an frt flanked neomycin selection cassette in the intron following exon B. The targeting vector also included a proline to alaline missense mutation at codon 12 (P12A) and loxP sites flanking exon B and the  neo cassete. mRNA corresponding to both Pparg1 and Pparg2 were significantly reduced in homozygous mutat white adipose tissue. While Pparg2 transcript was nearly undetected in homozygous mutant brown adipose tissue, Pparg1 was significantly increased rela tive to wild type.

MGI:2683413	Pparg<tm1.1Auw>	The frt flanked neomycin selection cassette was excised from Pparg<tm1Auw> via FLP mediated recombination. The proline to alanine missense mutation at codon 12 (exon B) was left intact. The levels of both Pparg1 and Pparg2 transcript in homozygous mutant  mice did not significantly differ from those of wild type.

MGI:2683633	H19<tm4Tilg>	Mutations were introduced at each of the 3 AB sites (AB-1, AB-2, and AB-3) located in the imprinting control region (ICR) upstream of the H19 transcription start site. Single loxP sites remained flanking the ICR after a floxed region containing neo and cr e was self-excised. The mutations were shown by EMSA to ablate binding activity. Imprint establishment and maintenance was unaffected in mutant mice.

MGI:2684314	Gt(ROSA)26Sor<tm1(Notch1)Dam>	A targeting vector containing a floxed neo cassette followed by a mouse Notch1 sequence fragment and GFP was inserted at the endogenous locus. Excision of the floxed neo cassette leads to the expression of the Notch1 sequence encoding an intracellular por tion of NOTCH1 (amino acids 1749-2293), but lacking the c-terminal PEST domain. IRES preceded the sequence encoding the nuclear-localized enhanced GFP.

MGI:2684610	Emx1<tm1Krj>	An IRES-cre gene followed by an FRT flanked PGK-neomycin gene was inserted 120 bp 3' of the stop codon.  The neomycin gene was later removed in vivo by crossing to an Flp recombinase expressing transgenic strain.  The protein product of this gene was prod uced in normal quantities as confirmed by Western blot analysis.  Cre recombinase expression was characterized by crossing to a Rosa26 strain.

MGI:2686837	Tcfap2a<tm1(cre)Moon>	An IRES-cre cassette followed by an frt-flanked neomycin gene was targeted downstream of the Tcfap2a coding region. The cassette was inserted 198 bp 3' of the stop codon and upstream of the polyadenylation signal.                                          	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2686838	Hoxa3<tm1(cre)Moon>	An IRES-cre cassette followed by an frt-flanked neomycin gene was targeted downstream of the Hoxa3 coding region. The cassette was inserted 4 bp 3' of the stop codon and upstream of the polyadenylation signal.                                              	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2687299	Pax3<tm2.1(PAX3/FOXO1A)Buck>	The floxed puromycin cassette was removed from Pax3<tm2(PAX3/FOXO1A)Buck> via cre mediated recombination, allowing for the expression of sequence encoding a human PAX3/FOXO1A fusion as well as lacZ.                                                         	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:2687304	Pax3<tm2(PAX3/FOXO1A)Buck>	The coding region of exon 1 was replaced with a cassette containing floxed puromycin, sequence encoding a PAX3-FOXO1A hybrid, and lacZ. The presence of the puromycin cassette prevents the expression of both the human PAX3-FOXO1A sequence and lacZ.        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:3027036	Mre11a<tm1Jpt>	An A-to-T transversion point mutation was engineered at nucleotide 1894 of the coding sequence to recapitulate a nonsense mutation identified in human patients (codon 633). This mutation results in the truncation of 75 amino acids.                        	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:3027260	Atp1a2<tm3Ling>	Two missense mutations (L111R and N122D) were engineered into exon 4. A floxed neo cassette included in the targeting vector was excised from intron 3 prior to germline transmission. The mutations, which manifest in the first extracellular domain of the a lpha 2 isoform, impair cardiac glycoside affinity. Western blot analysis of mutant mice indicated that the mutations did not affect either the level protein expression or the distribution of the alpha 1 and alpha 3 isoforms.                               	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:3027340	Ptprc<tm1Weis>	To recapitulate a mutation in the orthologous human gene that disrupts the inhibitory wedge, a glutamate to arginine substitution at codon 613 (E613R) was engineered in exon 18 and incorporated at the endogenous locus via homolgous recombination. A single  loxP site remained in intron 18 after the floxed neo cassette was excised.

MGI:3028660	Ercc4<tm1Fwa>	The endogenous exon 8 was replaced with a mutant version containing a nonsense mutation at codon 445. A single loxP site remained in intron 7 after the excision of a floxed neo cassette. Though the mutation was expected to generate a truncated transcript,  message was undetected by RT-PCR analysis of homozygous mutant MEFs.                                                                                                                                                                                          	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:3028920	Trp53<tm1Snj>	A mutation was introduced into exon 2 causing the serine at amino acid position 18 to be transformed to an Alanine.  At the same time, a floxed neomycin resistance gene was inserted in intron 1.  Subsequent excision of the neomycin cassette occured in the  F1 progeny of chimeric males as the result of expression of the protamine-Cre transgene which is endogenous to the PC3 ES cells used.

MGI:3029528	Bad<tm1Meg>	The sequences coding for the three regulatory serines:  Ser-112, Ser-136, and Ser-155 were all altered to code for alanines while an FRT flanked PGK-neomycin resistance cassette was inserted into the 3' UTR.  The neomycin gene was subsequently excised by  crossing mutant mice to transgenic mice that express FlpE recombinase.  Western blot analysis demonstrated that the level of protein expression was similar to that of the wild-type protein but that the protein produced could no longer be phosphorylated at  the three regulatory serines.

MGI:3029984	Runx1<tm1Toku>	A cDNA encoding a C-terminally RUNX1 protein was inserted into exon 4 of the endogenous locus via homologous recombination. The encoded protein truncates at residue 446 and thereby retains the trans-activating subdomains and lacks the VWRPY motif. Semiqua ntitative RT-PCR analysis of splenic and thymic message showed the levels of mutant transcript in homozygous mutant mice to be similar to the levels of normal transcript in wild type mice.

MGI:3032612	Actb<tm1(PyVT)Arge>	A targeting construct was designed to insert sequence encoding IRES, floxed neo, and polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyVT) in the 3' untranslated region of beta actin, 55 bp downstream of the sop codon. The inserted cassette leaves the endogenous coding re gion and the 54 bp 'zipcode' that directs cellular localization of beta actin intact. PyVT expression is dependent on the removal of the floxed neo cassette (which occured at low frequency without cre expression).                                          	Transgene induced (gene targeted)	Targeted (knock-in)
MGI:3032619	Actb<tm1(Tag)Arge>	A targeting construct was designed to insert sequence encoding IRES, floxed neo, and the SV40 early region in the 3' untranslated region of beta actin, 55 bp downstream of the sop codon. The sequence encoding the SV40 early region encoded large T, small t , and 17kT. The inserted cassette leaves the endogenous coding region and the 54 bp 'zipcode' that directs cellular localization of beta actin intact. Tag expression is dependent on the removal of the floxed neo cassette (which occured at low frequency wi thout cre expression).

MGI:2387834	Hdac9<tm1Eno>	Most of exon 4 and all of exon 5 were replaced by a cassette containing lacZ and neo inserted by homologous recombination. The deleted region encoded amino acids 99 through 176, encompassing the MEF2 binding domain, thus affecting the predominate MEF2-int eracting transcriptional repressor (MITR) splice form. RT-PCR and sequence analysis of mutant mice identified aberrant transcript in which the inserted cassette was excised and exon 3 had spliced to exon 6. This alternate splice pattern introduced two sto p codons immediately downstream of exon 3, and therefore precluded the translation of normal protein.

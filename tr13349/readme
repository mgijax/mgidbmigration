Descriptions of the top-level wrapper scripts
# This script runs both B39 and project database migration
1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out

# This script runs non-B39 loads
2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out

# this script runs ALL of B39 loads. This is the script to run on test and prod
3. MGI_part2b.csh >&& MGI_part2b.csh.out

    # These scripts are MGI_part2b.csh split into two pieces
    # so Sophia may view and edit the gff3blat mrkcoord file after 3.1
    # this is for DEV only
    3.1. MGI_part2b-1dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-1dev.csh.out
    3.2. MGI_part2b-2dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-2dev.csh.out

# This is our standard part 3, but with call to snpcacheload which should
# be removed befor the Alpha Build on TEST
5. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out

# This is our standard part 4 which runs all the reports
6. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

Development migration scrumdog bhmgiapp14ld --> mgi-testdb4.scrumdog
For MGI_part2b-1dev.csh:
    1. Sophia need to update GM or Assoc files in TR directory?
    2. Configure Genemodelload to load GMs - done as long as you don't
        cp genemodelload.config.default genemodelload.config
    3. Sophia need to review mgigff3 output? (to update problem seq set and/or
        gff3blat coord file?, if so publish)
For MGI_part2b-2dev.csh:
    1. Sophia need to review mgigff3 output? (to update problem seq set and/or
        gff3blat file?, if so publish)
    2. If we have non-gene coords (Paul's remap files), uncomment straingenemodelload, and config to load B6 and MGP:B6_ONLY=false
    3. if we have molecular note coords (Paul's remap file), uncomment mginoteload
    4. If we have variant coord file (Paul's remap file), uncomment update_variant_coords.csh
Run:
    1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out
    2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out
    3. IF Sophia NEEDS TO REVIEW mgigff3 output - if she updates problem seq set, she should publish, if she needs to
        update gff3blat coordinate file, she should place in /data/mrkcoord/current
        3a. MGI_part2b-1dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-1dev.csh.out
        3b. If Sophia updates problem seq set, she should publish, if she needs to
            update gff3blat coordinate file, she should place in /data/mrkcoord/current
        3c. run MGI_part2b-2dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-2dev.csh.out
    4. If Sophia DOES NOT NEED TO REVIEW mgigff3 output, etc.
        Run MGI_part2b.csh >& MGI_part2b.csh.out - this script runs everything in 2b-1dev and 2b-2dev and eliminates a second
        mgigff3/refresh call
    5. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out
    6. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

Alpha migration on TEST bhmgidevapp01 --> bhmgidevdb01.prod
For MGI_part2b.csh: 
    1. If we have non-gene coords (Paul's remap files), uncomment straingenemodelload and config to load B6 and MGP:B6_ONLY=false
    2. If we have molecular note coords (Paul's remap file), uncomment mginoteload
    3. If we have variant coord file (Paul's remap file), uncomment update_variant_coords.csh
    4. tag/install mgidbmigration
    5. copy riken and gff3blat files from bhmgiapp14ld:/data/mrkcoord/current to bhmgidevapp01:/data/mrkcoord/current
    7. If we have non-gene coords (Paul's remap files), copy all files from bhmgiapp14ld:/data/mrkcoord/current to bhmgidevapp
01:/data/mrkcoord/current
    8. Sophia publish problem seq set file
    9. Sophia need to update GM or Assoc files in TR directory?
    10. Dave Configure Genemodelload to load GMs
For MGI_Part3.csh:
    1. rm call to snpcacheload, this is run on different server on test and prod
Run:
    1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out
    2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out
    3. MGI_part2b.csh >& MGI_part2b.csh.out
    4. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out
    5. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

Production migration:
For MGI_part2b.csh:
    1. rm two calls to copydownloads.sh ensembl and copyinputs.sh ncbi
    2. Note: there are calls to ${GENEMODELLOAD}/bin/copyinputs.sh in this script for both ensembl and ncbi that need to run
    3. tag/install mgidbmigration with MGI_part3.csh change below
    4. copy riken and gff3blat files from bhmgiapp14ld:/data/mrkcoord/current to bhmgiapp01:/data/mrkcoord/current
    5. If we have non-gene coords (Paul's remap files), copy all files from bhmgiapp14ld:/data/mrkcoord/current to bhmgiapp01:/data/mrkcoord/current
    6. Sophia publish problem seq set file
    7. Dave Configure Genemodelload to load GMs

Run:
    1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out
    2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out
    3. MGI_part2b.csh >& MGI_part2b.csh.out
    4. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out
    5. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

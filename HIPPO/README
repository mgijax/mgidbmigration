Files:
for new IMPC load, we want to use the same files we used in development:
* scp mgi-testapp3:/data/downloads/www.ebi.ac.uk/impc.json to same directory on bhmgiapp01
* scp mgi-testapp3:/data/downloads/www.mousephenotype.org/mp2_load_phenotyping_colonies_report.tsv to same directory on bhmgiapp01
* remove /data/loads/mgi/htmpload/impcmpload/input/lastrun

Migration:
MGI_part2b.csh >& MGI_part2b.csh.out
* Run IMPC htmp load

MGI_part3.csh > MGI_part3.csh.out
* Runs cache loads (including rollupload)

MGI_part4.csh > MGI_part4.csh.out
* Runs reports

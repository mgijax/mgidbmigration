# If a PMID has an associated done HT Index Experiment, its GXDHT LitTriage status should = Indexed.
#
# If a PMID has been set to GXDHT=Indexed and it is not done, then its status should be changed to Chosen.
#
# PMIDs whose GXDHT status=Not Routed should be set to New.Â  
# (This is because this data type is not included in the LitTriage Classifier; 
# I picked an incorrect status when we set the system up originally.)
#
# There are PMIDs whose current GXDHT status = Chosen.  
# Some will become Indexed when you do the cleanup; otherwise leave them alone; Chosen is a perfectly acceptable status.
#
# None of the other GXDHT statuses --Routed, Full-Coded, Rejected--should be in use.

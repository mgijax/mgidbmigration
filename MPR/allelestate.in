Hemizygous X-linked			For X-linked alleles in males.	
Hemizygous Y-linked			For Y-linked alleles (males only).	
Hemizygous Insertion			For alleles contained in genomic insertions (e.g. transgenes).  In most cases, the insertion defines the allele (and Marker).	
Hemizygous Deletion			For instances where one homologous chromosome contains one or more linked mutant alleles, and the other homologous chromosome contains a large deletion that removes the region containing the gene(s) for the mutant allele(s).	
Heterozygous				
Homozygous				
Indeterminate			For instances where the allele condition is not known or not specified.

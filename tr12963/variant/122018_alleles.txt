A T-to-A mutation was identified in the exon 1 splice donor site leading to the inappropriate use of a downstream splice donor site. 25 extra nucleotides were included in the mRNA before splicing to the proper splice acceptor site in exon 2. This resulted in a frameshift and the incorporation of 49 missense amino acids before premature truncation of the protein occurred. In homozygote mice, no full-length or truncated protein was detected in retinal extracts. Heterozygote mice had a significant reduction of full-length protein in their retinas compared to wild-type controls.	chr17	46911279	46911279	T	A	Prph2:NM_008938.1:c.581+2T>A:p.?	SPLICE_DONOR_VARIANT

This change is predicted to result in a valine to glutamate change at position 234 of the encoded protein (p.V234E).	chr9	7170927	7170927	A	T	Dync2h1:NM_029851.2:c.701T>A:p.(Val234Glu),Dync2h1:XM_006509826.3:c.701T>A:p.(Val234Glu),Dync2h1:XM_006509827.3:c.701T>A:p.(Val234Glu),Dync2h1:XM_017313100.1:c.701T>A:p.(Val234Glu),Dync2h1:XR_001778791.1:n.1026T>A:,Dync2h1:XM_017313101.1:c.-41T>A:p.(=)	MISSENSE_VARIANT

The molecular lesion is a T-to-A single point mutation at position 20527406, exon 13, nucleotide 1412 of the cDNA that is predicted to convert L-to-Q at position 471 of the encoded protein (exon13:c.T1412A:p.L471Q, NM_007889).The mutant phenotype is attributed to a mutation in the Dvl3 gene.	chr16	20527333	20527333	T	A	Dvl3:NM_007889.2:c.1412T>A:p.(Leu471Gln),Dvl3:XM_006521779.3:c.1412T>A:p.(Leu471Gln),Dvl3:XM_006521780.2:c.1409T>A:p.(Leu470Gln),Dvl3:XM_006521782.3:c.1409T>A:p.(Leu470Gln),Dvl3:XM_011245824.2:c.1444T>A:p.(Cys482Ser)	MISSENSE_VARIANT

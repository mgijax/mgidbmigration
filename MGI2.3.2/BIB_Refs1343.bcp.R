Immunogenetics	15	1	1982 Jan	1982	1-16	Homology/CC	Y	Rodent cells were hybridized with owl monkey (Aotus) cells of karyotypes II, III, V, and VI. Aotus-rodent somatic hybrid lines preferentially segregating Aotus chromosomes were selected to determine the chromosomal location of the major histocompatibility complex and other genes with which it is synthetic in man. Based on correlation between concordant segregation of the chromosome as visualized by G-banding and expression of the Aotus antigens or enzymes in independent Aotus-rodent hybrid clones, we have assigned Aotus gene loci for the MHC, GLO, ME1, SOD2, and PGM3 to Aotus chromosome 9 of karyotype VI (2n = 49/50), chromosome 10 of karyotype V (2n = 46), and chromosome 7 of karyotype II and III (2n = 54 and 53). On the basis of banding patterns we previously postulated that these chromosomes of the different karyotypes were homologous. The gene assignments reported here provide independent evidence for that hypothesis. Aotus chromosomes 9 (K-VI), 10 (K-V), and 7 (K-II, III) are homologous to human chromosome 6 in that they all code for the MHC, GLO, ME1, SOD2, and PGM3. The structural differences between these homologous chromosomes probably resulted from a pericentric inversion.	0	Oct  1 1996 11:04:38:816AM	Oct  1 1996 11:04:38:816AM

To investigate further the extent of shared homology, we localized in the owl monkey complement two genes known to be on HSA 11q. Segregation analysis of ETS1 and THY1 homologous DNA in three karyotypically different panels of rodent x owl monkey somatic cell hybrids provided evidence for the syntenic assignment of these loci to homologous chromosomes of three owl monkey karyotypes, namely, chromosomes 4 (K-VI), 3 (K-II), and 5 (K-V).

The results obtained allowed us to make the following mink gene assignments: UMPH2, chromosome 8; PEPD and APRT, chromosome 7; PEPS, chromosome 6; and PSP and PGP, chromosome 14. The latter two genes are the first known markers for mink chromosome 14. For regional mapping, UMPH2 was analyzed in mouse cell clones transformed by means of mink metaphase chromosomes (Gradov et al., 1985) and also in mink x mouse hybrid clones carrying fragments of mink chromosome 8 of different sizes. Based on the data obtained, the gene for UMPH2 was assigned to the region 8pter----p26 of mink chromosome 8. The present data is compared with that previously established for man and mouse with reference to the conservation of syntenic gene groups and G-band homoeologies of chromosomes in mammals.	0	Jun 27 1995  2:30:14:833PM	Jun 27 1995  2:30:14:833PM

Genomics	9	4	1991 Apr	1991	581-6	Homology	Y	The genes HRAS, HBB, and CAT, which are located together on the short arm of human chromosome 11, appear to be part of a conserved synteny group found in many eutherian mammals. These genes were mapped to the chromosomes of two marsupial (metatherian) species by in situ hybridization. All three genes were located together on chromosome 3 in Macropus eugenii. Only HRAS and CAT were used to probe Dasykaluta rosamondae metaphases and these genes both mapped to chromosome 4. This suggests that the HRAS-HBB-CAT gene cluster has been conserved at least since the metatherians and eutherians diverged some 130 million years ago. These findings support the concept of a mammalian genome that has remained highly conserved throughout evolution.	0	Jun 27 1995  2:17:28:173PM	Jun 27 1995  2:17:28:173PM

Genomics	18	3	1993 Dec	1993	636-42	Homology	Y	We report the cloning and mapping of a gene (PDHA) for the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit in marsupials. In situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis show that PDHA is autosomal in marsupials, mapping to chromosome 3q in Sminthopsis macroura and 5p in Macropus eugenii. Since these locations represent a region that was translocated to the p arm of the human X chromosome following marsupial/eutherian divergence, we suggest that the marsupial PDHA gene is homologous to PDHA1, the somatic eutherian isoform located on human Xp and mouse X. Only one copy of PDHA is found in marsupials, whereas a second, testis-specific, intronless form is observed in eutherian mammals. We also suggest that translocation of PDHA to the eutherian X chromosome, which is inactivated during spermatogenesis, led to the evolution of a second testis-specific locus by retroposition to an autosome.	0	Jun 27 1995  1:13:37:866PM	Jun 27 1995  1:13:37:866PM

Cytogenet Cell Genet	33	3	1982	1982	213-21	Homology/CC	Y	The karyotype of microcebus murinus (MIM) (lemuridae) is considered by Dutrillaux (1979) as the closest to the karyotype ancestral to all primates. A large number of homoeologies exists between the banding patterns of MIM chromosomes and those of man (HSA). We report a comparison of the gene maps of these two species which confirms most of these homoeologies. Fifteen cell hybrids were obtained by fusing MIM fibroblasts and an HPRT- Chinese hamster cell line. Twenty-seven enzyme markers were investigated. The following assignments were demonstrated: NP to chromosome MIM 2, homoeologous to HSA 14; the syntenic group PGD-ENO1-PGM1 to MIM 3, homoeologous to HSA 1p; LDHA to MIM 5, homoeologous to HSA 11; Me1 to MIM 6, homoeologous to HSA 6; the syntenic group LDHB-CS-PEPB-ENO2-TPI to MIM 7, homoeologous to HSA 12; the syntenic group AK1-AK3 to MIM 10, which we considered to be homoeologous to HSA 9 (we do not consider MIM 9 to be homoeologous to HSA 9, as does Dutrillaux, 1979); GOT1 to MIM 15, homoeologous to HSA 10; the syntenic group HPRT-G6PD-PGK-GLA to MIM X. Synteny dissociation in three hybrids suggests closer linkage between G6PD and HPRT than between PGK-GLA and HPRT. Three syntenic groups, known in man, were confirmed in MIM but could not be assigned with full confidence: ACP1-MDH1, MP1-PKM2, and PEPD-GPI. GUK1 and PEPC, known to be syntenic in man, were found to be asyntenic in MIM and could not be assigned. PGM2 and SOD1 could not be assigned. A comparison of these gene assignments with those known in Cebus capucinus showed a remarkable homoeology for six chromosomes of the two species.	0	Jun 27 1995  3:01:08:580PM	Jun 27 1995  3:01:08:580PM

The chromosomes of rodent-marsupial (Macropus) cell hybrids, and gene assignments to the X chromosome of the grey kangaroo.		Chromosoma	91	1	1984	1984	20-7	Homology	Y	Somatic cell genetic mapping of marsupial and monotreme species will greatly extend the power of comparative gene mapping to detect ancient mammalian gene arrangements. The use of eutherian-marsupial cell hybrids for such mapping is complicated by the frequent retention of deleted and rearranged marsupial chromosomes. We used staining techniques, involving the fluorochromes Hoechst 33258 and chromomycin A3, to facilitate rapid and unequivocal identification of marsupial chromosomes and chromosome segments and to make chromosome assignment and regional localization of marsupial genes possible. Chromosome segregation in rodent-macropod hybrids was consistent with preferential loss of the marsupial complement. The extent of loss was very variable. Some hybrids retained 30% of the marsupial complement; some retained small centric fragments; and some, no cytologically identifiable marsupial material. We examined the chromosomes and gene products of a number of rodent-grey kangaroo Macropus giganteus hybrids, and have assigned the genes Pgk-A (phosphoglycerate kinase-A), Hpt (Hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyl transferase), and Gpd (Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) to the long arm of the kangaroo X chromosome, and provisionally established the gene order Pgk-A--Hpt--Gpd.	0	Jun 27 1995  2:58:51:106PM	Jun 27 1995  2:58:51:106PM

A number of HPRT-deficient revertant cell lines were derived from the hybrids. These possessed a variety of partially deleted X chromosomes. With these cell lines, it has been possible to establish the X-linkage of the genes for HPRT, G6PD, and PGKA in this marsupial and to localize these three genes to the terminal portion of the euchromatic arm of the red kangaroo X chromosome.	0	Jun 28 1995  1:59:13:006PM	Jun 28 1995  1:59:13:006PM

Genomics	13	4	1992 Aug	1992	1119-24	Homology	Y	We have mapped five human chromosome 21 (HSA 21) markers in marsupials and a monotreme, two major groups of mammals that diverged from eutherians 130-150 and 150-170 million years before present (MYrBP), respectively. We have found that these genes map to two distinct autosomal sites, one containing SOD1/CBR/BCEI and the other containing ETS2/INFAR, in the marsupials Macropus eugenii and Sminthopsis macroura (which belong to orders that diverged 40-80 MYrBP), as well as in the monotreme Ornithorhynchus anatinus (the platypus). Since marsupials and monotremes diverged independently from eutherians, these data suggest that HSA 21 genes were originally located in two separate autosomal blocks. In another Sminthopsis species, SOD1 is linked to TRF (a marker on HSA 3q), suggesting that the ancestral SOD1/CBR/BCEI region also included HSA 3 markers. We suggest that these blocks became fused early in the eutherian evolution to form a HSA 3/21 chromosome, which has remained intact in artiodactyls, but has been independently disrupted in both the primate and rodent lineages.	0	Nov 18 1996  1:55:15:893PM	Nov 18 1996  1:55:15:893PM

Nature	336	6201	1988 Dec 22-29	1988	780-3	Homology	Y	Sexual differentiation in placental mammals results from the action of a testis-determining gene encoded by the Y chromosome. This gene causes the indifferent gonad to develop as a testis, thereby initiating a hormonal cascade which produces a male phenotype. Recently, a candidate for the testis-determining gene (ZFY, Y-borne zinc-finger protein) has been cloned. The ZFY probe detects a male-specific (Y-linked) sequence in DNA from a range of eutherian mammals, as well as an X-linked sequence (ZFX) which maps to the human X chromosome. In marsupials it is also the Y chromosome that seems to determine the fate of the gonad, but not all sexual dimorphisms. Using the ZFY probe we find, surprisingly, that the ZFY homologous sequences are not on either the X or the Y chromosome in marsupials, but map to the autosomes. This implies ZFY is not the primary sex-determining gene in marsupials. Either the genetic pathways of sex determination in marsupials and eutherians differ, or they are identical and ZFY is not the primary signal in human sex determination.	0	Oct  3 1996  2:42:16:186PM	Oct  3 1996  2:42:16:186PM

J Hered	82	2	1991 Mar-Apr	1991	134-9	Homology	Y	The androgen receptor gene (AR), which is located on the long arm of the human X chromosome, was mapped by somatic cell analysis and in situ hybridization in marsupial and monotreme species. Both methods demonstrated that it was located on the X chromosome in each marsupial species, and also in the platypus. We conclude that this gene is part of a highly conserved region of the mammalian X, represented by the human Xq, which formed part of the X chromosome in a mammalian ancestor 150 million years ago. Since this gene is located proximally on the long arm of the monotreme X, which is G-band homologous to the Y and apparently exempt from X chromosome inactivation, the conservation of this region has evidently not depended on its isolation by X-Y differentiation or on X inactivation.	0	Oct 15 1996 12:51:12:226PM	Oct 15 1996 12:51:12:226PM

In many species it is detectable only in sperm, in spermatogenic testes and in epididymides containing sperm. In this paper, we provide evidence that some kangaroo species express low PGK-B activity in somatic tissues, in addition to high activity in testes. Three kangaroo species, M. rufogriseus, M. robustus and M. giganteus, exhibit polymorphism of PGK-B. Breeding data support the hypothesis of autosomal co-dominant inheritance, as is the case in mice. Population data for the three polymorphisms are discussed. PGK-B is not detectable in somatic tissues or spermatogenic testis extracts of monotreme mammals, birds or lizards; it is probably restricted to therian mammals.	0	Oct  1 1996  8:30:59:193AM	Oct  1 1996  8:30:59:193AM

Biol Reprod	53	2	1995 Aug	1995	285-94	Probes/Homology/MLC	Y	In the present study, we have isolated the cDNA for the mouse oviduct-specific glycoprotein (MOGP) by screening the mouse oviduct cDNA library with the bovine oviduct-specific glycoprotein (BOGP)-cDNA probe and by the 5' rapid amplification of the cDNA end (5'RACE). The total length of cDNA was determined to be 2525 base pairs (bp) by sequence analysis. The coding region contained 2163 bp translating to 721 amino acids. Based on comparisons with the N-terminal amino acid sequences of purified-BOGP and of hamster oviduct-specific glycoprotein (oviductin), it was inferred that the derived amino acid sequence contained a signal peptide region of 21 amino acids and a mature MOGP (core protein) region of 700 amino acids (76,515 daltons). It was also inferred that the mature MOGP contained three potential N-linked glycosylation sites and 24 possible O-linked glycosylation sites, and had the unique seven-residue repeat sequence (21 repeats) within the predicted sequence in the C-terminal side. The amino acid sequence of a portion of MOGP was highly homologous to that of BOGP (71% identity), baboon oviduct-specific glycoprotein (61% identity), and human oviduct-specific glycoprotein (77% identity). Significant homologies were also observed with two mammalian secretory proteins that were reported as a mammalian member of a chitinase protein family. Northern blot hybridization with a DIG-labeled probe indicated that a single message of 2.8 kb was present in total RNA prepared from oviductal tissue. In situ hybridization using MOGP-cDNA showed that a MOGP message was only detected in the oviductal epithelial cells. These results strongly suggest that a significant degree of homology exists among oviduct-specific glycoproteins of various mammalian species.	0	Aug 28 1995  8:37:31:680AM	Jul 15 1996  8:41:01:886AM

Cytogenet Cell Genet	76	3-4	1997	1997	139-43	Probes/Homology/	Y	In eukaryotic cells, protein transport between the endoplasmic  reticulum and Golgi compartments is mediated in part by  non-clathrin-coated vesicular coat proteins (COP). Seven COP  subunits have been recognized, and represent components of a  complex known as coatomer. We have previously isolated the cDNA  of the human homolog of alpha-COP, designated HEP-COP and given  the official gene symbol COPA. Here we report the genomic  organization of COPA, which contains 33 exons ranging in size  from 67 to 611 bp. Mapped by PCR and cycle sequencing, all the  exon-intron junctions conformed with the GT-AG rule, the 32  introns ranging from about 80 bp to 4 kbp, with the genomic DNA  of COPA estimated to span approximately 37 kb. Southern blot  analysis of genomic DNAs of nine eukaryotic species, from human  to yeast, revealed identical signals totaling 36 kb each for man  and monkey only. Using 5' RACE and primer extension analysis, the  putative transcriptional start site was localized to 466  nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon.  Comprising a 126-nucleotide 5' untranscribed genomic sequence and  a 466-nucleotide 5' noncoding cDNA sequence, the 592-nucleotide  5' CpG island lacked TATA and CAAT boxes but displayed a high G+C  content, was enriched for CpG dinucleotides, and contained a  potential Sp1-binding site, i.e., features compatible with a  housekeeping gene. COPA was mapped by fluorescence in situ  hybridization to chromosome region 1q23-->q25. 	0	Jul  9 1997  1:23:23:740PM	Feb 20 1998  8:47:02:510AM

Cytogenet Cell Genet	35	2	1983	1983	117-23	Homology/CC	Y	Biochemical analysis of cytogenetically defined rodent--owl monkey hybrid cell lines segregating owl monkey chromosomes allowed the assignment of 14 structural gene markers to seven owl monkey karyotype V (K-V, 2n = 46) chromosomes. Comparative study of assigned gene loci to chromosomes of owl monkey karyotype V (K-V, 2n = 46) and karyotype VI (K-VI, 2n = 49/50) provides the first evidence supporting some of the previously proposed mechanics of chromosomal rearrangements responsible for the great karyotypic diversity in owl monkeys. In addition, chromosome homologies deduced from gene loci of Aotus and other primates are compared here to determine the conservation or modification of chromosome morphology in the course of primate evolution. The data demonstrate the usefulness of gene mapping as an alternative to banding patterns for obtaining evidence on chromosome evolution.	0	Jun 27 1995  3:00:34:633PM	Jun 27 1995  3:00:34:633PM

Cytogenet Cell Genet	38	4	1984	1984	248-56	Homology/CC	Y	Fifteen gene loci for constitutive enzymes previously localized to specific owl monkey chromosomes of karyotypes III, V, and VI are confirmed by their assignments to homologous chromosomes of owl monkey karyotypes I, II, IV, and VII. The syntenic mapping of LDHA and GPI on a large metacentric, II-2, and the separate assignment of these two loci to two acrocentrics, I-9 and I-15, provide genetic evidence supporting the proposed fusion-fission event that characterized the karyotypic difference between owl monkeys inhabiting Colombia and the Panama Canal Zone. Moreover, the proposed hypothesis on chromosome polymorphism among the Colombian owl monkeys with karyotypes II, III, and IV, resulting from a fusion-fission event involving one metacentric and two subtelocentric pairs, is supported by the assignment of LDHB and MDH1 to the large metacentric I-2 and the separate localization of these two gene loci to II-13 and II-14, respectively.	0	Jun 27 1995  2:58:58:920PM	Jun 27 1995  2:58:58:920PM

Cytogenet Cell Genet	38	4	1984	1984	272-7	Homology	Y	We have mapped the albumin locus (ALB) in the owl monkey, Aotus trivirgatus, using a cloned human albumin gene probe, pcHSA 33-1. Rodent-owl monkey somatic cell hybrids were used to map the owl monkey albumin locus in three subgroups of Aotus, karyotypes II, V, and VI. Segregation analysis of the molecular hybridization pattern of pcHSA 33-1 in the somatic cell hybrids indicated that the albumin locus maps to chromosome 9 of owl monkey karyotype II, chromosome 12 of karyotype V, and chromosome 1 of karyotype VI. This assignment provides evidence for the homology of these three chromosomes and supports the hypothesis of Ma on the formation of chromosome 1 in karyotype VI.	0	Jun 27 1995  2:58:35:033PM	Jun 27 1995  2:58:35:033PM

J Hered	78	2	1987 Mar-Apr	1987	87-91	Homology	Y	Two cloned human DNA sequences specific for the SIS and IGLC genes were hybridized with DNAs from panels of rodent-owl monkey somatic cell hybrids. Independent segregation analysis of the related owl monkey DNA sequences for these two genes demonstrated that both the SIS locus and the IGLC locus are localized on owl monkey chromosome 3 of karyotype VI, chromosome 3 of karyotype V, and chromosome 6 of karyotype IV. These syntenic assignments provide genetic evidence for the homology of, at least, a portion of these chromosomes from three owl monkey karyotypes. The findings also help to redetermine the possible chromosome rearrangement that characterized the chromosome complement of owl monkey from Panama and northwestern Colombia with karyotypes II, III, IV, VIII, and IX from other owl monkey populations with karyotypes I, V, VI, VII, X, and XI.	0	Jun 27 1995  2:40:42:973PM	Jun 27 1995  2:40:42:973PM

Synteny of MOS and MYC gene loci in both man and owl monkey suggests this chromosome segment's conservation in primates, contrasting with its disruption in the mouse.	0	Jun 27 1995  2:41:34:540PM	Jun 27 1995  2:41:34:540PM

Cytogenet Cell Genet	65	4	1994	1994	250-5	Homology	Y	Using a variety of genetic methods, it is shown in this paper that the genes GLA, G6PD, HPRT, and PGK are X-linked in the vole Microtus subarvalis. The order of these genes has been investigated in two vole species, M. subarvalis and M. kirgisorum, by using the mapping technique of Goss and Harris (1977a, b), which depends on the analysis of gamma-ray-induced gene segregation. The experimental data were processed with the computer programme RHMAP (Ginsburg et al., 1993). The analysis indicated that the correct gene order in M. subarvalis is PGK-HPRT-G6PD-GLA, and the same gene order was found to be the most probable for M. kirgisorum. The relative distances between the genes in the two vole species are apparently the same. The RHMAP programme has also been applied to data previously reported for the same set of X-linked genes in the American mink (Zhdanova et al., 1988), the Australian marsupial Planigale maculata (Dobrovic and Graves, 1986), and man. The evolutionary conservation of the linear order of these X-linked genes in different mammalian taxa is discussed.	0	Jun 27 1995  1:15:45:426PM	Jun 27 1995  1:15:45:426PM

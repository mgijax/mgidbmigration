copy each template file to sprint#_part*.csh and edit as necessary

template_part1.csh - for running dev database load, do schema changes
    and migrate data
template_part2.csh - for running loads
template_part3.csh - for running reports

sprint1_part1.csh - runs dev database load for sprint 1
sprint1_part2.csh - runs loads for sprint 1
sprint1_part3.csh - runs reports for sprint 1

Notes:
------
The input file for the coordinate load is expected to be at:
	/data/loads/mgi/mrkcoordload/input/mrkcoordload.txt
This is currently a symbolic link to:
	/mgi/all/wts_projects/7100/7106/loads/C4AM_Sprint1_input.txt

Migration parts can be run from the mgiadmin crontab or from the
command-line.  If running from the command-line, be sure to capture
stdout and stderr to a file.

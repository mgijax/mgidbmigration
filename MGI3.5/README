MGI 3.5 Schema Changes:

To support GO qualifiers for Annotations (TR 5188):

	Affects:  EI, WI, Annotation loader, GO Text generator

	A new "Qualifier" vocabulary and terms replaces the "isNot"
	bit in the VOC_Annot table.  This supports the GO consortium
	requirements for annotation qualifiers.

        VOC_AnnotType:
                . added "_QualifierVocab_key" (foreign key to VOC_Vocab)

		This field defines the Qualifier Vocabulary (in VOC_Vocab)
		that is used for this Annotation Type.

		Example:

		For the Marker/GO Annotation Type (_AnnotType_key = 1000), 
		the GO Qualifier Vocabulary (_Vocab_key = 52) terms are:

		. colocalzies with
		. contributes to
		. NOT colocalizes with
		. NOT contributes to
		. NOT
		. none (null)

        VOC_Annot:
                . added "_Qualifier_key" (foreign key to VOC_Term)
                . removed "isNot"

	MRK_OMIM_Cache:
		. added "qualifier" varchar
		. removed "isNot" bit

To improve performance, we split SEQ_Sequence into 2 tables (TR 7094):

	Affects:  EI, WI, Sequence loader

        SEQ_Sequence:
                . added "_Organism_key" (foreign key to MGI_Organism)

		This field defines the primary Organism of the Sequence.
		For a protein sequence (that may have multiple organisms),
		this field is set by precedence (mouse, human, rat).

                . all "raw" fields moved to SEQ_Sequence_Raw

        SEQ_Sequence_Raw:
                . new table

To improve performance, add the primary accession id to the cache table:

	Affects: nothing; backward compatible

        SEQ_Marker_Cache:
                . added primary accession id (accID)

Increase size of ACC_Accession.prefixPart (TR 7182):

	Affects:  nothing; backward compatible
	SNP load can be modified, however, to set the prefixPart

	ACC_Accession, ACC_AccessionMax:
		. increase size of prefixPart to 30

Backups:
rohan:/backups/rohan/scrum-dog/mgd_dev[12]

To load the backup into your test database:
- example
	load_db.csh DEV1_MGI mgd_lec1 /backups/rohan/scrum-dog/mgd_dev

To simulate a weekly/monthly Sanger load:
- run MGI_part2.csh && comment out lines that are running the tests

MGI_part1.csh
- runs the schema scripts needed to convert production Sybase to TR10273/schema
- should be run with a fresh copy of production database:
	MGI_part1.csh dev

MGI_part2.csh
# 1. run Sanger dataload with Sanger BioMart as input
# 2. run 'runtest_part1' to load the Sanger test data
# 3. run 'runtest_part1A' to load the Sanger test data (additional genotypes)
#
# STOP here if "additional genotypes" IDs are changing from last run
#
# 4. run Europhenome dataload with Europhenome BioMart as input
# 5. run 'runtest_part1' to load the Europhenome test data
# 6. run 'runtest_part2' to load additional genotypes & annotations for testing (sanger)
# 7. run 'runtest_part3' to review the tests (pass/fail) (sanger)

Cardolan:Cron:
- turn on
- the exporter/mover can now be run on cardolan
  cardolan:/usr/local/mgi/scrum-dog/exporter/bin/exportPostgres_htmpload.sh

MGI_part3.csh
- runs caches

MGI_part4.csh
- runs the mirror_wget to grab a new copy of the Sanger Biomart file
- runs the htmpload-er using the sanger biomart input file

Exact		E	The JAX strain genotype/background is identical to the genotype to which phenotype data are annotated.  That is, the literature/data submission describes phenotyping of the exact JAX mouse.	
Not Exact		NE	The JAX strain genotype/background differs from the genotype to which phenotype data are annotated.  That is, the literature/data submission describes the phenotype of the allele combination(s), but on a different genetic background thant that of the JAX mouse.

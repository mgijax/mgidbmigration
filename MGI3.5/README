MGI 3.5 Schema Changes:

To support GO qualifiers for Annotations (TR 5188):

	Affects:  EI, WI, Annotation loader, GO Text generator

	A new "Qualifier" vocabulary and terms replaces the "isNot"
	bit in the VOC_Annot table.  This supports the GO consortium
	requirements for annotation qualifiers.

        VOC_AnnotType:
                . added "_QualifierVocab_key" (foreign key to VOC_Vocab)

		This field defines the Qualifier Vocabulary (in VOC_Vocab)
		that is used for this Annotation Type.

		Example:

		For the Marker/GO Annotation Type (_AnnotType_key = 1000), 
		the GO Qualifier Vocabulary (_Vocab_key = 52) terms are:

		. colocalzies with
		. contributes to
		. NOT colocalizes with
		. NOT contributes to
		. NOT
		. none (null)

        VOC_Annot:
                . added "_Qualifier_key" (foreign key to VOC_Term)
                . removed "isNot"

	MRK_OMIM_Cache:
		. added "qualifier" varchar
		. removed "isNot" bit

To improve performance, split SEQ_Sequence into 2 tables (TR 7094):

	Affects:  EI, WI, Sequence loader

        SEQ_Sequence:
                . added "_Organism_key" (foreign key to MGI_Organism)

		This field defines the primary Organism of the Sequence.
		For a protein sequence (that may have multiple organisms),
		this field is set by precedence (mouse, human, rat).

                . all "raw" fields moved to SEQ_Sequence_Raw

        SEQ_Sequence_Raw:
		A record in this table represents the Sequence Provider
		(for example, GenBank) values of the Sequence attributes 
		that MGI attempts to resolve to MGI vocabulary values.
		For example, strain, tissue, gender, etc.

                . new table

To improve performance, add the primary accession id to the cache table:

	Affects: nothing; backward compatible

        SEQ_Marker_Cache:
                . added primary accession id (accID)

To improve performance, add accession ids to the cache table:

	Affects:  nothing, backward-compatible

	MRK_Reference (cache table):
		. added mgi ID (MGI:####, varchar)
		. added jnum ID (J:####, varchar)
		. added jnum (integer)
		. added pub med ID (varchar)

	MRK_reloadReference (stored procedure)
		. removed loading of records from PRB_Reference (fix)

To eliminate an unnecessary table, remove MLD_Marker table (TR 7530):

	Affects:  EI, Mapping load

	MLD_Marker:
		. remove

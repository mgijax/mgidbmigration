Backups:
rohan:/backups/rohan/scrum-dog/mgd_dev[12]

To load the backup into your test database:
- example
	load_db.csh DEV1_MGI mgd_lec1 /backups/rohan/scrum-dog/mgd_dev

To simulate a weekly/monthly Sanger load:
- run MGI_part2.csh && comment out lines that are running the tests

MGI_part1.csh
- runs the schema scripts needed to convert production Sybase to TR10273/schema
- should be run with a fresh copy of production database:
	MGI_part1.csh dev

MGI_part2.csh
- runs the htmpload-er using the sanger biomart input file
- runs htmpload/test/runtest_part1.sh (sanger test + additional genotypes)
- the genotype IDs generated in this step can then be used
  for the additional annotations loaded in part2
- input files in htmpload/test directory:
	mgi_htmpload_test.txt
	mgi_genoload_test.txt
- to execute:
	MGI_part2.sh
- the exporter/mover can now be run on cardolan
  cardolan:/usr/local/mgi/scrum-dog/exporter/bin/exportPostgres_htmpload.sh

STOP; if the a new database backup is being used, then the additional mp + omim
file needs to be updated with the new genotype ids created by part2

MGI_part3.csh
- runs htmpload/test/runtest_part2.sh (additional mp + omim)
- runs htmpload/test/runtest_part3.sh (review)
- input files in htmpload/test directory:
	mgi_annotload_test.txt
	mgi_omimload_test.txt
- to execute:
	MGI_part3.sh

MGI_part4.csh
- runs caches

MGI_part5.csh
- runs the mirror_wget to grab a new copy of the Sanger Biomart file
- runs the htmpload-er using the sanger biomart input file

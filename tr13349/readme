Descriptions of the top-level wrapper scripts
# This script runs both B39 and project database migration
1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out

# This script runs non-B39 loads
2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out

# this script runs ALL of B39 loads. This is the script to run on test and prod
3. MGI_part2b.csh >&& MGI_part2b.csh.out

    # These scripts are MGI_part2b.csh split into two pieces
    # so Sophia may view and edit the gff3blat mrkcoord file after 3.1
    # this is for DEV only
    3.1. MGI_part2b-1dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-1dev.csh.out
    3.2. MGI_part2b-2dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-2dev.csh.out

# This is our standard part 3, but with call to snpcacheload which should
# be removed befor the Alpha Build on TEST
5. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out

# This is our standard part 4 which runs all the reports
6. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

Development migration scrumdog bhmgiapp14ld --> mgi-testdb4.scrumdog
For MGI_part2b-1dev.csh:
    1. Sophia need to update GM or Assoc files in TR directory?
    2. Configure Genemodelload to load GMs - done as long as you don't
        cp genemodelload.config.default genemodelload.config
    3. Sophia need to review mgigff3 output? (to update problem seq set and/or
        gff3blat coord file?, if so publish)
For MGI_part2b-2dev.csh:
    1. Sophia need to review mgigff3 output? (to update problem seq set and/or
        gff3blat file?, if so publish)
    2. If we have non-gene coords (Paul's remap files), uncomment straingenemodelload
    3. if we have molecular note coords (Paul's remap file), uncomment mginoteload
    4. If we have variant coord file (Paul's remap file), uncomment update_variant_coords.csh
Run:
    1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out
    2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out
    3. IF Sophia NEEDS TO REVIEW mgigff3 output - if she updates problem seq set, she should publish, if she needs to
        update gff3blat coordinate file, she should place in /data/mrkcoord/current
        3a. MGI_part2b-1dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-1dev.csh.out
        3b. If Sophia updates problem seq set, she should publish, if she needs to
            update gff3blat coordinate file, she should place in /data/mrkcoord/current
        3c. run MGI_part2b-2dev.csh >& MGI_part2b-2dev.csh.out
    4. If Sophia DOES NOT NEED TO REVIEW mgigff3 output, etc.
        Run MGI_part2b.csh >& MGI_part2b.csh.out - this script runs everything in 2b-1dev and 2b-2dev and eliminates a second
        mgigff3/refresh call
    5. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out
    6. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

Alpha migration on TEST bhmgidevapp01 --> bhmgidevdb01.prod
For MGI_part2b.csh: 
    1. If we have non-gene coords (Paul's remap files), uncomment straingenemodelload
    2. If we have molecular note coords (Paul's remap file), uncomment mginoteload
    3. If we have variant coord file (Paul's remap file), uncomment update_variant_coords.csh
    4. tag/install mgidbmigration
    5. copy riken and gff3blat files from bhmgiapp14ld:/data/mrkcoord/current to bhmgidevapp01:/data/mrkcoord/current
    7. If we have non-gene coords (Paul's remap files), copy all files from bhmgiapp14ld:/data/mrkcoord/current to bhmgidevapp
01:/data/mrkcoord/current
    8. Sophia publish problem seq set file
    9. Sophia need to update GM or Assoc files in TR directory?
    10. Dave Configure Genemodelload to load GMs
For MGI_Part3.csh:
    1. rm call to snpcacheload, this is run on different server on test and prod
Run:
    1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out
    2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out
    3. MGI_part2b.csh >& MGI_part2b.csh.out
    4. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out
    5. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out

Production migration:
For MGI_part2b.csh:
    1. rm two calls to copydownloads.sh ensembl and copyinputs.sh ncbi
    2. Note: there are calls to ${GENEMODELLOAD}/bin/copyinputs.sh in this script for both ensembl and ncbi that need to run
    3. tag/install mgidbmigration with MGI_part3.csh change below
    4. copy riken and gff3blat files from bhmgiapp14ld:/data/mrkcoord/current to bhmgiapp01:/data/mrkcoord/current
    5. If we have non-gene coords (Paul's remap files), copy all files from bhmgiapp14ld:/data/mrkcoord/current to bhmgiapp01:/data/mrkcoord/current
    6. Sophia publish problem seq set file
    7. Dave Configure Genemodelload to load GMs

Run:
    1. MGI_part1.csh >& MGI_part1.csh.out
    2. MGI_part2.csh >& MGI_part2.csh.out
    3. MGI_part2b.csh >& MGI_part2b.csh.out
    4. MGI_part3.csh >& MGI_part3.csh.out
    5. MGI_part4.csh >& MGI_part4.csh.out
